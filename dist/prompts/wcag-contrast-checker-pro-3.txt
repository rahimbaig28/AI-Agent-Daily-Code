WCAG Contrast Checker Pro

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS only; no external libraries or dependencies.
- Main feature: Color contrast analyzer tool for WCAG compliance (AA/AAA levels).
- UI: Clean interface with two color pickers (foreground/background), live preview box showing sample text with applied colors, contrast ratio display (e.g., "4.72:1"), WCAG pass/fail badges (AA/AAA), and manual hex/RGB inputs with validation.
- Color input: Click-to-pick from preview, eyedropper simulation via color input[type=color], sliders for RGB/HSV, copy-to-clipboard for hex values.
- Auto-detection: Button to sample colors from any image pasted into a drag-and-drop zone (use FileReader + canvas to extract palette of 8 dominant colors).
- Results table: Shows ratio, WCAG status, recommended adjustments; sortable by ratio; keyboard-navigable with ARIA roles (role="grid", aria-labels).
- Accessibility core: Full keyboard support (Tab-focusable inputs/buttons, Enter/Space activation, arrow keys for sliders), high-contrast focus outlines (3px solid #00f), ARIA live regions for ratio updates, semantic HTML (fieldset, legend, button[aria-pressed]), resizes text to 200% zoom, screen-reader friendly (announce "Contrast 4.72:1, passes AA").
- Theme: Auto dark/light mode via matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)'), manual toggle button with persistence via localStorage.
- Persistence: Save recent color pairs (up to 20) in localStorage; load on start; clear button.
- Share: Generate URL hash with current colors (e.g., #fg=ff0000&bg=ffffff), parse on load, share button copies URL.
- Export/Import: Download JSON of saved pairs (filename "contrasts.json"), upload via file input to restore.
- Test features: 
  - Keyboard-only: Tab through all controls, adjust sliders with arrows, test contrast.
  - Screen reader: NVDA/VO announces ratios, statuses, focus changes.
  - Mobile: Touch-friendly pickers/sliders, responsive grid (CSS media queries @media (max-width: 600px)).
  - Edge cases: Invalid colors (show error aria-live), low-contrast warning beep (new Audio()), large text mode toggle (1.5x font-size).
- Responsive: Flexbox grid, works on desktop/mobile; min-height 100vh.
- Performance: <1000 lines total; no loops >100ms; throttle input events.
- Legal: Inline WCAG contrast formula from W3C (perceivable/contrast-minimum).
