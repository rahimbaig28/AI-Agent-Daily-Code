Habit Tracker Pro

- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, os, datetime, pathlib, curses for TUI).
- Persistent data in ~/habit_tracker.json (auto-create if missing).
- Track daily habits with streak counters, completion status, and weekly summaries.
- Keyboard-first TUI using curses: arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select/toggle, 'q' to quit, 'a' to add habit, 'd' to delete.
- Main screen: responsive grid showing habits in columns (Name | Streak | Today ✓/✗ | This Week %).
- Auto-detect dark/light terminal theme via os.environ['TERM'] or default to light.
- Date-aware: uses datetime.date.today() for current day, calculates streaks from last completion dates.
- Commands:
  * View mode: Display all habits in table, highlight overdue (red), perfect week (green).
  * Add habit: Prompt for name (max 20 chars), optional target days/week (default 7).
  * Toggle completion: Mark/unmark today for selected habit, update streak.
  * Stats: 's' key shows top streaks, avg completion rate.
  * Reset day: 'r' to mark all incomplete for yesterday.
- Data format: JSON list of dicts [{"name": str, "streak": int, "weekly_target": int, "history": [date_strs]}].
- Save/load on every action, graceful error handling (e.g., corrupted JSON resets to empty).
- Testable features:
  1. Run script, add "Water 2L", toggle complete 3 days, verify streak=3.
  2. Check weekly % after 4/7 days complete.
  3. 'q' quits cleanly, data persists.
  4. Terminal resize refreshes grid cleanly.
- Under 800 LOC total, exit codes: 0 success, 1 data error.
