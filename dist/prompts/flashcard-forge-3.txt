Flashcard Forge
- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, os, random, datetime, argparse).
- Core purpose: Create, study, and manage spaced repetition flashcards for learning.
- Command-line interface with subcommands: add, study, list, import, export, stats.
- Data persistence: Store cards in 'flashcards.json' as list of dicts: {"front": "str", "back": "str", "next_review": "ISO datetime", "interval": int (days), "ease": float (2.5-5.0)}.
- Spaced repetition algorithm: After study, update interval = prev_interval * ease (min 1 day), next_review = today + interval, ease adjusted by quality (0-5 scale: 5=hard, 0=easy).
- "add" subcommand: Prompt for front/back text, add card with next_review=today.
- "study" subcommand: Load due cards (next_review <= today), show front, wait for Enter to reveal back, prompt quality (0-5), update SRS stats, repeat until no due cards.
- "list" subcommand: Show all cards sorted by next_review, format: ID | Front... | Due: YYYY-MM-DD.
- "import" subcommand: Read JSON file, merge/overwrite existing cards by front text.
- "export" subcommand: Write all cards to JSON file.
- "stats" subcommand: Show total cards, due today/this week, avg ease, longest streak.
- Use argparse for CLI: python flashcard.py study --limit 20 (default unlimited).
- Color output: Use ANSI escapes for due (red), reviewed (green).
- Keyboard shortcuts in study: 'q'=quit, 's'=skip (no SRS update), 'd'=delete card.
- Handle empty deck: Suggest "python flashcard.py add".
- Error handling: Validate JSON, handle missing file (auto-create []), Ctrl+C graceful exit.
- Testable: Run "add" (2 cards), "study" (reviews them), "export" (check JSON), "stats".
