Eco Impact Tracker

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS (no external libraries or resources).
- Theme: Environment & sustainability - tracks personal carbon footprint from daily activities.
- Main UI: Clean dashboard with drag-and-drop zones for activity cards (transport, food, energy, waste).
- Activity cards: 12 predefined draggable cards (e.g., "Drive 10km", "Beef dinner", "AC 8hrs") with pre-calculated **CO2e values** (kg) based on standard EPA/GHG data.
- Drag-and-drop: Drop cards into weekly grid (7 days x 4 categories); supports reordering, remove via drag to trash.
- **Real-time carbon calculator**: Displays daily/weekly total CO2e, progress bar toward 2-tonne monthly goal, and equivalent stats (e.g., "X trees planted", "Y flights avoided").
- **Persistence**: Save/load via URL hash (shareable links) + localStorage backup.
- Input modal: Edit/add custom activities with kg CO2e field (ARIA modal dialog).
- **ARIA compliance**: All interactive elements have roles/labels (role="grid", aria-label, aria-live for totals), full keyboard nav (Tab, Arrow keys for drag sim, Enter to drop/select).
- Visuals: Earth-toned CSS (greens #4CAF50, earth #8D6E63), responsive grid (mobile-first), smooth animations (CSS transitions for drag).
- Stats panel: Bar charts (SVG, no libs), tips section ("Switch to bike: save 0.2kg/km"), reset/share buttons.
- Testable features:
  * Drag "Drive 10km" (2.3kg) to Monday transport → daily total updates.
  * Keyboard: Tab to card, Enter+Arrow to move/drop.
  * URL share: #mon:drive10km|tue:beef preserves state.
  * Custom: Add "Flight NYC-LAX" (500kg) → recalculates.
- Keep under 800 LOC: Modular JS (drag logic ~150L, calc ~50L, hash/sync ~100L, ARIA ~50L).
