Number Guess Duel

• Single-player micro game where the user guesses a random number between 1–100 in the fewest attempts possible.
• Game tracks current streak (consecutive wins) and best streak across sessions using a JSON file in the user's home directory (~/.number_guess_stats.json).
• Each game displays: target range, current guess count, feedback ("too high," "too low," "correct"), and running statistics (current streak, best streak, total games played, average guesses per game).
• Keyboard-first UX: arrow keys or number input to guess, Enter to submit, 'q' to quit, 'r' to restart, 'c' to clear stats.
• Difficulty modes selectable at startup: Easy (1–50), Normal (1–100), Hard (1–500). Each mode tracked separately in stats.
• Colorized terminal output: green for correct, red for wrong, yellow for hints. Auto-detect terminal dark/light mode via environment variables (COLORFGBG or similar fallback to dark).
• Win condition displays encouragement message with performance rating (e.g., "Excellent!" for ≤5 guesses, "Good" for ≤10).
• Stats persist across sessions; user can view lifetime stats before starting a new game.
• No external dependencies; uses only random, json, os, and sys from standard library.
