CashFlow Grid Analyzer
- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, datetime, os, curses for TUI).
- Persistent data in 'cashflow.json' with transactions as list of dicts: {'date': 'YYYY-MM-DD', 'amount': float, 'category': str, 'desc': str}.
- Keyboard-first curses TUI: arrow keys navigate grid of transactions (10x20 char cells), Enter adds/edits, 'd' deletes, 's' sorts by date/amount/category, 'q' quits.
- Responsive grid view: displays 20 latest transactions in table with columns (date, amount, category, balance), auto-refreshes running balance.
- Add transaction: prompt date (default today), amount (+income/-expense), category (Food/Groceries/Rent/Utilities/Entertainment/Salary/Other), description.
- Edit: arrow to select row, Enter to inline-edit fields with tab to cycle.
- Stats dashboard: 'r' key shows pie-like ASCII chart of category spending % (this month), total income/expense/balance.
- Monthly filter: 'm' toggles current month view, resets on 'm' again.
- Drag-sim via keyboard: hold 'Shift+arrow' to "drag" reorder rows (swap with adjacent).
- Auto-save every 5 actions and on exit; load on start, handle missing file.
- Error handling: validate float amounts/dates, graceful fallback on corrupt JSON.
- Testable: run script, add 5 txns (2 income, 3 expense), verify grid/balance/chart, edit/delete, check JSON persistence.
