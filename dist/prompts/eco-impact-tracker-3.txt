Eco Impact Tracker

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS (no external dependencies).
- **Core purpose**: Track personal carbon footprint from daily activities (transport, energy, food, waste) with sustainability scores and tips.
- **Responsive grid layout**: 12-column CSS Grid; mobile-first (1-col <600px, 2-col 600-900px, 3-col >900px); full-width on all devices.
- **Data persistence**: localStorage saves entries, totals, and goals across sessions; auto-load on startup; export/import JSON via download/upload.
- **Drag-and-drop zones**: 4 category grids (Transport, Energy, Food, Waste); drag activity cards between grids or within to reorder; drop to log with quantity input popup.
- **Keyboard-first UX**: Tab-focusable elements; Arrow keys navigate/reorder cards in grids; Enter to log/select; Esc closes popups; Space toggles expand/collapse; full ARIA labels/roles.
- **Activity cards**: 20 predefined draggable cards (e.g., "Car trip 10km", "Veggie meal", "Recycle plastic"); each shows CO2e kg, icon (SVG), edit quantity button.
- **Logging**: Drop card triggers modal (quantity spinner, date picker default today); calculate CO2e (hardcoded multipliers: car=0.2kg/km, flight=0.15kg/km, etc.); add to daily/weekly totals.
- **Dashboard**: Top grid shows live **total CO2e**, daily/weekly charts (SVG canvas bars), **sustainability score** (0-100, color-coded: green<10kg/day), progress to user-set goal.
- **Tips panel**: Expandable accordion below dashboard; shows 5 dynamic tips based on highest category (e.g., "Switch to biking: saves 0.2kg/km"); keyboard-navigable.
- **Features list**:
  * Add custom activity button: modal for name, CO2e/kg, icon choice.
  * Reset day/week buttons with confirmation dialog.
  * Dark mode toggle (prefers-color-scheme + button); high-contrast mode.
  * Undo last log (stack of 10 actions).
  * Testable: Preload sample week data button; console asserts totals match expected.
- **Visuals**: Earth-toned palette (#2E7D32 green, #4CAF50 accent); SVG icons (car, plane, leaf); smooth animations (0.3s ease drag/drop).
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA; screen-reader friendly (live regions for totals); 2x zoom testable; skip-to-content link.
- **Performance**: <800 LOC total; 60fps drag; no frameworks; vanilla JS only.
