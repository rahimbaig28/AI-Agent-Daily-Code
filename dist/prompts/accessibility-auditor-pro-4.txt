Accessibility Auditor Pro

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS, no external dependencies.
- Offline-first: uses localStorage to save audit history (up to 50 recent audits).
- Core feature: Real-time **ARIA compliance checker** for pasted HTML snippets.
- Main UI: Clean, high-contrast dark/light theme toggle (persists in localStorage, respects prefers-color-scheme).
- **Input area**: Large resizable <textarea> (ARIA-labeled "Paste HTML to audit", keyboard-navigable).
- **Audit button**: Prominent button triggers analysis, shows loading spinner.
- **Results panel**: Live-updating list of issues grouped by severity (Critical, Serious, Moderate, Minor).
  - Each issue: Description, line number, suggested fix, "Copy fix" button.
- ARIA compliance: All interactive elements have role="button"/"checkbox", aria-labels, aria-live for dynamic updates, focus management.
- Keyboard support: Tab navigation, Enter to audit, Arrow keys for results list, Esc to clear.
- **Share feature**: Generate URL hash with encoded audit results (e.g., #issue=missing-alt&line=5) for bookmarking/sharing.
- Checks for: Missing alt on images, unlabeled form controls, low contrast ratios (simple RGB calc), missing ARIA roles, invalid ARIA values.
- Persistence: Audit results auto-save to localStorage with timestamps; load latest on open.
- Responsive: Mobile-first grid layout, 320px min-width, touch-friendly buttons (>44px).
- Testable features:
  1. Paste <img src="x"> → Flags missing alt.
  2. Toggle theme → Persists, updates CSS vars.
  3. Run audit → Speaks results via aria-live.
  4. Share URL → Copies to clipboard, reloads from hash.
  5. Clear history → Confirms via dialog.
- CSS: Use :focus-visible, custom properties for theming, smooth transitions.
- JS: ~400 LOC max, event delegation, no frameworks.
