Micro Game Arena

• Single-file Python 3 script (standard library only) that runs a local web server serving an interactive micro-game collection
• Game 1: Number Guess (computer picks 1-100, player has 7 attempts, binary search hints)
• Game 2: Reaction Time (measure milliseconds to click after random delay, track best time)
• Game 3: Memory Tiles (grid of 4x4 tiles, flip to match pairs, timer tracks completion speed)
• Game 4: Quick Math (rapid-fire arithmetic problems, score based on speed and accuracy)
• Serve a single HTML page (embedded in Python string) with inline CSS and vanilla JS
• Keyboard-first navigation: arrow keys to select games, Enter to play, ESC to return to menu
• Full ARIA labels, semantic HTML, high contrast mode toggle, screen-reader friendly
• Persistent high scores stored in a JSON file (scores.json) in the script's directory
• Drag-and-drop to reorder games on the menu (desktop only, graceful fallback)
• Responsive design (mobile-friendly, touch-friendly buttons)
• No external libraries; use http.server and json from standard library
• Game stats dashboard showing total games played, average scores, personal bests
• Simple theme: dark mode by default with accessible color palette (WCAG AA minimum)
• Start server on localhost:8000, auto-open browser on launch (or print URL if headless)
