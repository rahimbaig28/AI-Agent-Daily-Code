StudyFlow: Spaced Repetition Flashcard System

• Single-file Python 3 script using only the standard library (json, sqlite3, datetime, argparse, random)
• Core feature: Create, organize, and review flashcards with automatic spaced repetition scheduling
• Users can add cards via CLI with front/back text; cards stored in local JSON file (cards.json)
• Review mode shows one card at a time; user grades recall (1-5 scale) to adjust next review date
• Algorithm: Cards scheduled using simplified SM-2 (ease factor, interval multiplier based on grade)
• Keyboard-first: Navigate with arrow keys, enter grade with number keys (1–5), 'q' to quit, 'a' to add new card
• Statistics dashboard: Shows total cards, cards due today, average ease, and study streak (consecutive days studied)
• Persistence: All card data, grades, and review history saved to cards.json; no external dependencies
• Offline-first: Fully functional without internet; all computation local
• Import/export: Ability to load cards from plain-text file (one card per line, format: "front|back")
• Study session summary: After reviewing, display cards mastered, cards to review again, and optimal next session time
• Accessibility: Clear prompts, no colors required for functionality, all text-based interface
