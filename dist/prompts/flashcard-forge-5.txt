Flashcard Forge
- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, os, sys, urllib.request, hashlib, webbrowser).
- Create ~/flashcards.json for persistence; auto-create if missing.
- Command-line interface with keyboard-first UX: accept single chars ('a' add, 's' study, 'v' view, 'e' edit, 'd' delete, 'q' quit).
- Add card: prompt for front (question) and back (answer); store as list of dicts [{"front": "...", "back": "..."}].
- Study mode: shuffle deck randomly, show front, wait for Enter to reveal back, 's' skip, 'g' good, 'b' bad (moves bad cards to front).
- View all: numbered list of front/back pairs.
- Edit/delete: select by number from view list.
- Share via URL hash: generate base64-encoded JSON of all cards, copy to clipboard (use print fallback if no clipboard), open default browser to data: URL for sharing.
- Responsive grid simulation: study mode shows 1-3 cards per screen with clear separators.
- Testable features: run script, add 3 cards, study (mark 1 good/1 bad), delete 1, share URL, verify ~/flashcards.json saves correctly.
- Handle edge cases: empty deck, invalid inputs, file permissions.
- Shebang #!/usr/bin/env python3; if __name__ == "__main__": main().
