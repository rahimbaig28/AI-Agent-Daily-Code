Accessible Note Composer
- Single-file Python 3 script using ONLY standard library (json, os, sys, datetime, pathlib, curses, readline).
- Console-based note-taking app with accessibility focus: full keyboard navigation, screen reader friendly output.
- Auto-detects dark/light terminal theme using os.environ['TERM'] and adjusts colors (high contrast for dark, soft for light).
- Persistent storage: saves notes to `notes.json` in script directory (array of dicts: {"timestamp": str, "content": str}).
- Core features:
  * `n` new note (timestamped, multiline input via readline).
  * `l` list notes (numbered, shows date/content preview, arrow/page up/down navigation).
  * `v <num>` view note (full content, pager-style scrolling).
  * `e <num>` edit note (load into readline editor, overwrite).
  * `d <num>` delete note (confirm with y/n).
  * `p` print-friendly export (saves notes.txt with plain text, timestamps, separators for printing).
  * `q` quit (auto-save).
- Undo/redo stack (10 levels): Ctrl+Z undo, Ctrl+Y redo (covers edit/delete).
- Curses TUI mode toggle: run with `--tui` flag for full-screen interface (hjkl navigation, / search).
- Help: `h` shows command list with key bindings.
- Error handling: validates JSON on load, creates backup on corruption.
- Usage: `python notecomposer.py` (CLI) or `python notecomposer.py --tui` (full screen).
- Keep total code <800 lines: prioritize readline for input, simple dict-based state.
