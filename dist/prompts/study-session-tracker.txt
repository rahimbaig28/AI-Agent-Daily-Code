Study Session Tracker

• Single-file Python 3 script using standard library only (json, datetime, random, pathlib)
• Track study sessions with subject, duration (minutes), and completion date
• Persist all session data to a local JSON file in the user's home directory
• Display statistics: total hours studied, sessions per subject, longest streak (consecutive days studied)
• Command-line interface with keyboard-first navigation (arrow keys to select menu options, Enter to confirm)
• Menu options: Start Session, View Stats, Review History, Export to Text, Clear Data
• Auto-calculate and display daily study goals based on historical patterns
• Generate motivational messages using random selection from a built-in message library
• Validate input (subject names, durations) with clear error messages
• Support for dark/light terminal output detection (check environment variables or default to auto-detect based on system)
• Print-friendly text export that formats session data and statistics for easy copying to documents
• Timestamp all sessions with automatic timezone handling
• Keyboard shortcuts: Q to quit any menu, R to reset current input, S to save and exit
• Minimal dependencies: works with Python 3.7+ and requires only standard library modules
• Estimated code size: 800–950 lines including comments and data validation
