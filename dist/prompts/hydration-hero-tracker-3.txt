Hydration Hero Tracker

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS only, no external libraries or dependencies.
- Auto-detects system dark/light mode preference using matchMedia and toggles theme (CSS custom properties for colors: light #f8fafc bg/#1e293b bg; dark #0f172a bg/#f1f5f9 bg).
- Responsive grid layout: 12-column CSS Grid for all screens (mobile-first: 1-col <768px, 2-col 768-1024px, 3-col >1024px).
- Core feature: Daily water intake tracker with 8 drag-and-drop glass icons (500ml each, SVG sprites, draggable with HTML5 Drag API).
- Drag glasses from "Available" column to "Consumed" column; visual fill animation (CSS keyframes scale + color shift to blue).
- Real-time total display (e.g., "3.5L / 3L goal") with circular progress ring (SVG stroke-dasharray).
- Customizable daily goal input (1-5L slider, persists via localStorage).
- Keyboard support: Tab-focusable glasses (Enter/Space to toggle consumed, Arrow keys to move focus in grid).
- Add streak counter: Tracks consecutive days meeting goal (localStorage, resets if missed).
- Data persistence: localStorage saves consumed glasses, goal, streak; auto-load on refresh.
- Reset day button (confirms via dialog, clears consumed glasses but keeps streak/goal).
- Accessibility: ARIA labels/roles (e.g., aria-label="Drag glass 1", aria-live for total updates), high-contrast mode compatible, screen-reader friendly announcements.
- Motivational quotes: Random daily quote from 10 wellness hydration quotes array, fades in on load.
- PWA-ready: Manifest inline, service worker stub for offline (cache HTML/CSS/JS).
- Testable: Load page, drag 6 glasses, change goal to 4L, refresh verifies persistence/streak++, toggle theme works responsively.
