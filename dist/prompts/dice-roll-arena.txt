Dice Roll Arena

• A turn-based dice rolling game where the player competes against the CPU opponent
• Players take turns rolling virtual dice (d6, d12, d20 configurable); highest roll wins the round
• Track cumulative scores across multiple rounds; first to reach target score (default 100) wins the match
• CPU opponent uses simple AI: rolls same die type as player, with occasional "aggressive" or "defensive" strategy selection
• Undo/redo functionality: player can undo up to last 3 rolls before confirming round; CPU moves cannot be undone once confirmed
• Game state persists to JSON file in user's home directory (~/.dice_arena_game.json); resume last game on startup
• Display current round number, both players' scores, dice selection buttons (d6/d12/d20), roll history for current round
• Keyboard support: arrow keys to select die type, Enter to roll, U for undo, R for redo, N for new game
• CLI output with clear formatting showing each roll result, running totals, round winner, and match status
• Settings: adjustable target score (50–500) and difficulty level (easy/normal/hard affecting CPU strategy)
• End-game summary displays winner, total rounds played, and option to save replay log to text file
