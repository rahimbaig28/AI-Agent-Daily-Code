Habit Streak Tracker
- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (tkinter, json, os, webbrowser).
- Main window with title "Habit Streak Tracker" and centered layout (800x600).
- Display current date (YYYY-MM-DD) at top.
- List of habits: each habit shows name, current streak count, last completed date, checkbox for today.
- Button bar: "Add Habit" (new window with text entry for habit name), "Complete Selected", "Undo Last", "Redo", "Print View", "Share Hash".
- Persistence: save/load habits and streaks as JSON in "habits.json" in script directory; auto-load on start, auto-save on changes.
- Streak logic: checkbox marks habit complete for today; increment streak if consecutive days, reset to 1 if missed; update last date.
- Undo/redo: stack-based history (max 20 actions) for add/edit/delete/complete actions; buttons enabled/disabled by state.
- Print view: generate text summary (habit, streak, last date) to console and offer "Print" (webbrowser.open temp HTML file with printable CSS).
- Share via URL hash: compute simple hash (hash(name+streak) % 10000), copy "habitstracker://"+hash to clipboard (print to console with instructions).
- Keyboard support: Enter to add habit, Space to toggle checkbox, Ctrl+Z undo, Ctrl+Y redo, Ctrl+P print, Ctrl+S save.
- Visual: Green for active streaks >3, yellow for 1-3, red for 0; sort list by streak descending.
- Edge cases: handle missing JSON, duplicate names (prevent), streak calc across dates (use datetime.date).
- Testable: add habit "Run", complete 3 days, undo one, check streak=2, print shows correct summary.
