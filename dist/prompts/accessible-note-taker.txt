Accessible Note Taker

- Build a single-file web app (one HTML file with inline CSS and JS) for creating, editing, and managing short notes.
- All UI elements must be fully accessible: support keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space, arrow keys), screen reader announcements, and visible focus states.
- Each note is a plain text block with a unique ID; users can add, edit, and delete notes.
- Implement undo/redo functionality for note actions (add, edit, delete) using a stack-based approach.
- Persist notes and undo/redo history in localStorage so data survives page reloads.
- Allow sharing of notes via URL hash: encode all notes as a compact string in the URL fragment; on load, parse and restore notes if present.
- Include a hidden aria-live region to announce actions (e.g., "Note added", "Undo performed") for screen readers.
- Style with high-contrast defaults, clear focus outlines, and responsive layout for mobile and desktop.
- Keep the interface minimal: a form to add/edit notes, a list of notes, and undo/redo buttons.
- Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate ARIA roles and labels.
