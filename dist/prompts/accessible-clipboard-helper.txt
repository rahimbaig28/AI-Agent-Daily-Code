  - Add snippet: save current clipboard or typed input as a named snippet.
  - List snippets: show all saved snippet names.
  - Retrieve snippet: copy snippet content to clipboard or print it.
  - Delete snippet by name.
  - Export/import snippets from/to JSON file.
- Includes input validation and confirmation prompts to prevent data loss.
- Runs as a standalone script with no external dependencies, compatible with Python 3.7+.
- Uses only the Python standard library, leveraging `json`, `os`, `sys`, `subprocess`, `platform`, `shutil`, and `argparse`.
- Designed for quick accessibility support workflow and snippet sharing on any machine without installing extra tools.
