Literature Review Tracker
- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, os, datetime, pathlib, sys, readline).
- CLI app for researchers to track papers with title, authors, year, notes, status (todo/reading/done).
- Auto-detect dark/light terminal theme using os.environ['TERM'] brightness detection or simple toggle.
- Persistence: JSON file "litreview.json" in script directory or XDG_DATA_HOME.
- Core commands via interactive menu (loop with input()):
  * add: prompt for title/authors/year/notes/status, auto-add datetime.
  * list: show filtered list by status/todo, sorted by date added.
  * edit: select by index, re-prompt fields.
  * search: fuzzy title/author search with str.find().
  * stats: count by status, avg year, recent adds.
* Undo/redo stack: 10 levels deep using list of JSON snapshots, undo/redo commands.
* Export/import full database as "litreview_export.json".
* Keyboard shortcuts in interactive mode: q=quit, u=undo, r=redo, n=add.
* Help command shows all options.
* Example data structure: [{"id":0,"title":"Paper Title","authors":"A B","year":2023,"notes":"Summary","status":"todo","added":"2026-01-13"}]
* Error handling: validate year (int 1900-2030), backup JSON before changes.
* Testable: start empty, add 3 papers, list, undo last, export, quit/restart shows data.
