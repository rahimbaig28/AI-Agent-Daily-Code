Habit Streak Tracker
- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, datetime, os, sys).
- Command-line interface for tracking daily habits with streak counters.
- Data stored in 'habits.json' as list of dicts: {"name": str, "streak": int, "last_date": str (YYYY-MM-DD)}.
- Main menu loop: display current habits/streaks, add habit, mark habit done today, edit habit name/streak, delete habit, export to 'habits_backup.json', import from JSON file, quit.
- On startup: load habits.json if exists, else start empty; auto-prune habits with streak 0 if not done recently.
- "Mark done" checks today's date (via datetime.date.today().isoformat()); if already marked today, warn; else increment streak and update last_date; if yesterday's date matches, streak++; else reset to 1 if first time.
- Display: sorted by streak descending, show name/streak/last_date; color-code with ANSI (green for active streak, red for broken).
- Export: copy habits.json to habits_backup_TIMESTAMP.json with current datetime.
- Import: prompt for JSON file path, validate structure, merge/overwrite existing.
- Print-friendly: 'print' command outputs clean table to console (tabular format with headers) and saves to 'habits_print.txt'.
- Edge cases: handle missing/corrupt JSON (backup and reset), validate habit names (no empty/dupe), keyboard quit (Ctrl+C graceful exit saving data).
- Persistence: auto-save after every change; on exit confirm unsaved changes.
- Testable: run script, add "Run 5km" -> mark done x3 days -> verify streak=3 -> delete -> export/import -> print view matches.
