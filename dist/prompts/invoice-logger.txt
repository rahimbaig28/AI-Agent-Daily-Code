Invoice Logger

• Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, datetime, uuid, argparse)
• Track small business invoices with invoice number, client name, amount, date, and status (draft/sent/paid)
• Store all invoices in a local JSON file (invoices.json) in the script's directory; auto-create on first run
• Command-line interface with these operations:
  - `add`: Create a new invoice with interactive prompts
  - `list`: Display all invoices in a formatted table (sorted by date, newest first)
  - `update <invoice_id> --status <status>`: Mark invoice as draft, sent, or paid
  - `delete <invoice_id>`: Remove an invoice
  - `export <filename>`: Export invoices to a JSON file for backup or sharing
  - `import <filename>`: Import invoices from a JSON file (merge with existing)
  - `stats`: Show summary (total invoiced, total paid, outstanding amount, invoice count by status)
• Each invoice auto-assigned a unique ID and creation timestamp
• Input validation: amount must be positive number, status limited to allowed values, client name required
• Graceful error handling: file not found, invalid JSON, missing required fields
• Human-readable output: currency formatted with two decimals, dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
• No external dependencies; runs on Python 3.6+
