Literature Gap Finder
- Single-file Python 3 script using ONLY standard library (no pip, no external deps).
- CLI research utility: Analyzes local text files (e.g., research papers, notes) to identify **literature gaps** by finding underrepresented topics.
- Core algorithm: 
  - Read multiple .txt files via command line args (e.g., `python gapfinder.py paper1.txt paper2.txt notes.txt`).
  - Extract sentences using simple punctuation splitting.
  - Build term frequency table (case-insensitive, stop words filtered: the,a,an,and,or,but,in,on,at,to,for,of,with,by,is,are,was,were,be,been).
  - Score topics by TF-IDF (term frequency * inverse document frequency across files).
  - Rank and display **top 10 lowest-coverage topics** (potential research gaps) with example sentences.
- Command line interface with argparse:
  - Positional: one or more input .txt files.
  - `--min-words 3`: minimum words per topic phrase (default 3).
  - `--output gaps.json`: save results as JSON (default: print to stdout).
  - `--print-friendly`: format output for terminal printing with clear sections.
- Persistence: Save/load previous analysis to `gapfinder_cache.json` in script directory for incremental analysis.
- Keyboard-first UX: Full tab-completion support via argparse; clear error messages with suggestions.
- Output format:
  - Table of gaps: Topic | Coverage Score | Example Sentences | Files Mentioned.
  - Sorted by lowest coverage first.
  - JSON export with full metadata for further analysis.
- Error handling: Validate files exist, handle empty files, non-text content gracefully.
- Testable features:
  - `echo "AI ethics important" > a.txt; echo "ML bias problem" > b.txt; python gapfinder.py a.txt b.txt` → shows "quantum computing" as gap if not present.
  - Handles 100+ KB files efficiently with streaming read.
  - Under 800 lines total code.
- Shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`; works cross-platform (Windows/Linux/Mac).
