CashFlow Grid

- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, datetime, os, curses, shutil).
- Terminal-based budgeting app with keyboard-first UX using curses for responsive grid display.
- Data persistence: Store transactions in 'cashflow.json' as list of dicts: {"date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "amount": float, "type": "income/expense", "category": str, "desc": str}.
- Main screen: Full-terminal grid showing monthly summary (rows: categories like Food/Groceries, Rent/Utilities, Income, Savings; columns: Budgeted/Actual/Diff).
- Keyboard navigation: Arrow keys move cell focus (blue highlight), Enter edits cell, Tab cycles months, 'a' adds transaction, 'd' deletes focused row, 's' saves/quits.
- Add transaction: Popup form (date auto-defaults today), amount/category/type/desc via keyboard input, Enter confirms.
- Monthly view toggle: '1'-'9' jumps to specific past/current months, aggregates by category using datetime filtering.
- Calculations: Auto-sum actuals per category/month, compute differences (green positive/red negative), net cashflow at bottom.
- Drag-and-drop simulation: Hold 'Shift' + arrow keys to "drag" row up/down for reordering categories.
- Budget setup: First run prompts initial monthly budgets per category, persists in json.
- Error handling: Validate floats/dates, backup json on load, confirm deletes.
- Testable features: Run script, add 5 transactions across 2 months, verify grid sums/diffs, reorder rows, toggle months, quit with data saved.
- Compact: <800 LOC target, clear menu on startup/help key (? shows controls).
