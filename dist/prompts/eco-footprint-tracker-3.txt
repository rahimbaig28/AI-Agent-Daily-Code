Eco Footprint Tracker
- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS (no external dependencies).
- Offline-first: Use localStorage to persist daily carbon footprint data (food, transport, energy categories).
- Main UI: Dark green theme (#2d5016 bg, #90ee90 accents), responsive grid for desktop/mobile.
- Input form: Numeric inputs for daily activities (e.g., km driven, kWh used, meals eaten) with unit labels and validation (0-1000 range).
- **Calculate button** computes total CO2e (kg/day) using fixed factors: car=0.2kg/km, electricity=0.5kg/kWh, meat meal=2kg, veggie=0.5kg.
- Display weekly total and average (7 days), bar chart via Canvas (green bars, 300px wide, animate height on update).
- **Keyboard-first UX**: Tab-focusable inputs/buttons, Enter to calculate/add day, Arrow keys to navigate days list, Escape clears form.
- Days list: Show last 7 entries as clickable cards (date, total CO2e, edit/delete), load from/saves to localStorage on change.
- URL sharing: Encode current data as base64 hash (JSON of days array), parse on load, update hash on save (window.onhashchange).
- Progress indicator: Radial SVG gauge (0-10kg/day scale) with current average, green/orange/red zones.
- Reset button: Clears localStorage with confirmation dialog.
- Accessibility: ARIA labels on inputs/chart, high contrast text, screen-reader friendly (role="slider" on inputs, live regions for totals).
- Service Worker simulation: Add <script> for basic offline caching of app shell via Cache API.
- Test features: Add 7 sample days on first load, verify chart renders, hash shares correctly, persists after refresh/offline.
