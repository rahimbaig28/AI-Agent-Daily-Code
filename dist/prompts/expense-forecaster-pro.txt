Expense Forecaster Pro

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS; no external dependencies or libraries.
- Offline-first: uses localStorage to persist all data (budgets, transactions, forecasts).
- Keyboard-first UX: full tab navigation, Enter to submit forms/add items, Arrow keys/Esc for lists, shortcuts (Ctrl+N new tx, Ctrl+E export, Ctrl+I import).
- Dark/light mode toggle via Ctrl+L or theme button; persists in localStorage; accessible with high contrast and ARIA labels.
- Core UI: responsive grid layout (mobile-first CSS Grid/Flexbox) with header (app title, theme toggle, export/import buttons), main sections (budget overview, transaction list, forecast chart), and input form.
- Budget setup: predefined categories (Food, Transport, Bills, Entertainment, Savings, Other) with monthly limits ($500 Food, $200 Transport, etc.); editable limits via inline inputs (Enter to save); visual progress bars (green <80%, yellow 80-100%, red >100%).
- Add transactions: modal form (amount as number input with $ prefix, date picker defaulting to today, category dropdown, description text); validate required fields, prevent negative amounts; auto-categorize if over limit shows warning.
- Transaction list: sortable table (click headers for date/amount/category); delete via Del key or button; filter by category/date range dropdowns; shows running balance.
- Forecast chart: simple HTML Canvas bar graph showing current month spending vs budget + projected (next 7/30 days based on avg daily spend); updates live; color-coded (spent green, projected orange, over red).
- Calculations: total income field (editable), net balance = income - expenses; projected spend = avg daily * days left; alerts if projected > budget.
- Export/Import: JSON download button (all data: budgets, tx history); file input to import/parse JSON; overwrite confirmation dialog.
- Persistence: auto-save every change to localStorage; load on init with fallback empty data; clear data button with confirmation.
- Accessibility: semantic HTML (sections, labels, roles), focus outlines, screen-reader friendly (live regions for updates), skip links.
- Polish: smooth CSS transitions/animations (<0.3s), mobile swipe for delete, PWA-like manifest in <head> for offline install, error toasts for invalid inputs.
- Testable features: add 5 tx, edit budget, toggle theme, export/import, verify forecast updates, keyboard-only flow, responsive at 320px/768px.
