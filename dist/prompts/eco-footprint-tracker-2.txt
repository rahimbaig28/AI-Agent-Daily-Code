Eco Footprint Tracker
- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, os, datetime, statistics, curses for TUI).
- Persistent data storage in 'footprint_data.json' using JSON for daily carbon footprint entries.
- Theme: Environment & sustainability - track personal carbon footprint from transport, energy, food, waste categories.
- Main TUI screen shows responsive grid (curses window) with today's totals, 7-day average, and tips for reduction.
- Keyboard navigation: arrow keys to select category, Enter to edit value (kg CO2), Tab for next field, 's' to save, 'v' to view history, 'q' to quit.
- Input fields for 4 categories: Transport (car/bus/train), Energy (kWh used), Food (meals: low/medium/high impact), Waste (kg recycled/non-recycled).
- Auto-calculate daily total using fixed factors: transport=0.2kg/km (prompt for km), energy=0.5kg/kWh, food={low:1,medium:2.5,high:4}kg/meal, waste=0.1kg/non-recycled.
- Display print-friendly summary: use print() to output table of last 7 days + average + tips (e.g., "Switch to train: save 0.15kg/km").
- Stats: mean/median weekly footprint, trend arrow (↑↓→ based on statistics.mean), goal check (<5kg/day = "Green!").
- ARIA-like accessibility: read screen aloud on Enter using print statements, clear labels, keyboard-only operation.
- New Year feature: On 2025-12-31 or later, show "2026 Eco Reset" with yearly total from data and reset option.
- Testable: Run script, enter data for 3 days, verify JSON saves/loads, stats update, quit/reopen preserves data.
- Error handling: Validate numeric inputs, backup JSON on corruption, graceful curses fallback to console if not terminal.
- Under 800 LOC: Use curses for 80x24 grid layout, dict for data {date: {cat:val, total:float}}.
