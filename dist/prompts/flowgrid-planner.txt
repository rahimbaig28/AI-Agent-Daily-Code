FlowGrid Planner

- Single-page web app for organizing personal tasks into a responsive time-and-priority grid, with JSON export/import and shareable URL states.
- Layout:
  - Full-viewport centered container with a responsive CSS grid.
  - Header bar with app title, compact stats (tasks today / completed), and a theme toggle (light/dark).
  - Main area split vertically:
    - Left: task input panel and filters.
    - Right: responsive "FlowGrid" board showing tasks in a grid grouped by time blocks and priority.
  - Footer bar with controls: export/import JSON, clear data, help/about.
- Task model:
  - Each task has: id, title (required), optional description/notes, date, time block (Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Anytime), priority (Low/Medium/High), status (Pending/In Progress/Done), optional tag (one short text label), and createdAt timestamp.
- Task input:
  - Form fields: title text input, description textarea, date input (defaults to today), time-block select, priority select, tag text input.
  - "Add task" button and keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Enter or Cmd+Enter) to submit when focus is inside the form.
  - Basic inline validation: prevent empty title, highlight invalid fields with red border and concise error text.
- FlowGrid board:
  - Responsive CSS grid with columns representing time blocks and rows representing priority levels, or vice versa, adapting layout based on viewport width.
  - For wide screens: columns = time blocks, rows = High / Medium / Low.
  - For narrow screens: stacks into sections; each time block appears as a collapsible group with internal priority separation.
  - Each cell shows tasks as cards; if many tasks, vertical scrolling within the cell.
- Task cards:
  - Compact card with title (bold), status indicator, small colored priority dot, tag pill, and optional description preview (first line).
  - Clicking a card opens an overlay dialog for editing all fields (including changing status, date, and deleting).
  - Checkbox or small button on card to toggle status: Pending → In Progress → Done.
  - Visually differentiate Done tasks (dimmed, strikethrough title).
- Filtering and focus controls:
  - Filter bar with:
    - Date selector (defaults to today, quick "Today" button).
    - Priority filter (All / High / Medium / Low).
    - Status filter (All / Pending / In Progress / Done / Active = Pending+In Progress).
    - Tag filter: text input with autocomplete of existing tags; empty means all tags.
    - Quick toggle "Hide done" to remove completed tasks from grid view.
  - Filters update view instantly without page reload.
- Search:
  - Single search box that filters tasks by title, description, and tag (case-insensitive substring match).
  - Search works in combination with filters.
- Keyboard accessibility:
  - All interactive elements (form fields, buttons, task cards, menu items) reachable via Tab order.
  - Enter/Space activates focused buttons and toggles.
  - Esc closes modals (edit dialog, import/export overlays, help).
  - Arrow keys to navigate between task cards inside the grid when a card has focus (left/right/up/down moves to neighboring card if present).
- Data persistence:
  - All tasks, filters’ last used settings (except search text), and theme preference saved to localStorage on every change.
  - On load, app restores state from localStorage; if none, starts with an empty example task or brief inline hint.
- JSON export/import:
  - Export:
    - "Export JSON" button opens a modal with a read-only textarea containing a pretty-printed JSON representation of the current data (tasks array, plus basic settings like theme).
    - "Copy to clipboard" button to copy JSON (using the Clipboard API with graceful fallback).
  - Import:
    - "Import JSON" button opens a modal with an editable textarea.
    - User can paste JSON; "Preview import" validates structure:
      - If valid, shows brief summary: number of tasks, earliest/latest dates.
      - If invalid, shows an error message without altering existing data.
    - "Apply import" replaces current data only after confirmation; success and error messages appear clearly.
- Share via URL hash:
  - When filters (date, tag, status, priority) change, the app encodes a compact representation into location.hash (e.g., current date, tag, and filter states).
  - On load, if a hash is present, it initializes filters from the hash (but still loads tasks from localStorage).
  - Provide a "Copy view link" button that updates and copies the current URL with hash for sharing the same view configuration (not the underlying data).
- Stats and focus indicators:
  - Header shows counts for current date view: total tasks, completed tasks, and percent done.
  - Optional small horizontal bar or ring showing completion percent for that date.
  - A "Focus mode" toggle that:
    - Hides side panels and dim non-focused cells.
    - Focus cell is chosen based on current time block and High+Medium priority; user can cycle focus cell with left/right arrows or on-screen arrows.
- Theme and visual design:
  - Two themes: light (default) and dark; toggle button in header.
  - Use CSS variables for colors, spacing, and border radii to keep styles manageable.
  - Clear color coding for priority: e.g., High=red, Medium=amber, Low=green, ensuring sufficient contrast.
  - Respect prefers-reduced-motion; keep animations minimal and purely CSS-based.
- Help/about panel:
  - "Help" button opens a small overlay explaining:
    - What the app does.
    - Basic keyboard shortcuts.
    - How JSON export/import and URL share work.
  - Include a reset link inside help to immediately clear localStorage and reload with a clean slate (after confirmation).
- Implementation constraints:
  - Single HTML file with inline CSS in a <style> tag and inline JS in a <script> tag, no external libraries.
  - Use only vanilla JS, standard DOM APIs, and localStorage.
  - Code organized into small functions for: state management, rendering grid, filters, modals, and URL hash handling.
