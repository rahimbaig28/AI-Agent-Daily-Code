Habit Tracker Pro

- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, os, datetime, curses for TUI).
- Console-based terminal UI with curses: full-screen keyboard-navigable interface, no mouse required.
- Core features:
  - Track daily habits (e.g., "meditate", "exercise") with streak counters and completion checkboxes.
  - Add/edit/delete habits via keyboard shortcuts: 'a' add, 'e' edit, 'd' delete selected.
  - Daily view: list habits with completion status (Y/N/?), navigate with arrow keys, toggle with Enter/Space.
  - Weekly/monthly streak summary screen: switch views with Tab, shows longest/current streaks.
- Keyboard-first UX: 
  - Arrow keys/Vim hjkl for navigation, Enter to select/toggle, 'q' quit, 's' save, 'u' undo last action.
  - Undo/redo stack (up to 10 actions) with 'z' undo, 'y' redo.
- Persistence: JSON file "habits.json" in script directory, auto-save on quit/every 5 mins, load on start.
  - Data structure: {"habits": [{"name": str, "streak": int, "history": [YYYY-MM-DD booleans]}]}
- Offline-first: fully local, no network.
- Testable features:
  - Add habit "Read 30min", toggle complete for 3 days → streak=3.
  - Undo toggle → streak resets correctly.
  - Switch to weekly view → shows accurate summary.
  - Edit habit name, delete habit → data persists after restart.
- Responsive TUI: resize-aware, color-coded (green=complete, red=missed, yellow=streak), help overlay with '?' key.
- Edge cases: empty habits list, long habit names wrap, date gaps auto-mark missed.
