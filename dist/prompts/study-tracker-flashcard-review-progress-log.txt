Study Tracker: Flashcard Review & Progress Log

- Build a single-file web app (HTML/CSS/JS) for creating, reviewing, and tracking progress on custom flashcards for study and learning.
- Users can add new flashcards with a front (question) and back (answer), edit or delete existing cards, and mark cards as "known" or "needs review".
- Flashcards are stored in localStorage for offline-first use; data persists across sessions.
- Include a review mode that shows cards in random order, lets users flip to see the answer, and logs their self-assessment (e.g., "got it" or "forgot").
- Show a progress dashboard with stats: total cards, cards marked as known, cards needing review, and review history.
- Add keyboard shortcuts for navigation (e.g., Enter to flip, Space to mark as known, Backspace to delete).
- Implement undo/redo for the last action (add, edit, delete, mark) using a simple stack-based approach.
- Provide a print-friendly view that displays all cards in a clean, readable layout for offline study.
- Ensure the UI is accessible: use semantic HTML, ARIA labels, and support screen readers.
- No external libraries; all code must be in one HTML file with inline CSS and JS.
