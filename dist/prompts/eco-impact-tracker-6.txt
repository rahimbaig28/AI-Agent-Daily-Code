Eco Impact Tracker

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS, no external dependencies, offline-first using localStorage.
- Dark green/earth tone color scheme (#2E7D32, #4CAF50, #A5D6A7) with responsive design (mobile-first, breakpoints at 768px/1024px).
- Header: App title "Eco Impact Tracker", tagline "Track your daily sustainability actions", share button (copies URL with hash-encoded data).
- Core UI: Weekly calendar grid (Mon-Sun, current week by default, prev/next buttons), each day shows 5 toggleable **eco actions** (Water Saved, Energy Saved, Waste Reduced, Transport Low-Carbon, Plant-Based Meals).
- Input: Numeric input per action (e.g., liters, kWh, kg) with unit labels, validate 0-999, enter commits value.
- Metrics dashboard below calendar: Real-time totals (Weekly Impact Score = sum of all weighted values: Water=1x, Energy=2x, Waste=3x, Transport=4x, Meals=2x), CO2 equivalent saved (hardcode multipliers: 1L water=0.00039kg CO2, etc.), progress bars to weekly goals (e.g., 100L water).
- **Undo/Redo**: Ctrl+Z/Y or buttons, 10-step history stored in localStorage per session.
- **Persistence**: Load/save all data to localStorage ('ecoData_v1'), auto-save every 30s, clear data button with confirm.
- **Share via URL hash**: Encode week offset + all action values as base64 string in #hash, load from hash on init, update hash on changes for bookmarkable links.
- Keyboard: Tab-focusable inputs/buttons, Enter to commit, Arrow keys navigate days, Esc clears input.
- Footer: Reset week button, export CSV (download 'eco-week.csv' with headers Date,Action,Value,Score), "Impact tip" rotates 5 sustainability facts.
- Animations: Smooth toggle transitions (0.3s ease), confetti burst on weekly goal hit (canvas-based, 20 particles).
- Edge cases: Handle empty weeks (show "No data"), offline warning if localStorage quota hit, PWA-ready (manifest inline, service worker stub for cache).
- Test features: Add data to 3 days, verify totals/CO2 calc, undo changes, share URL and load in incognito, resize to mobile.
