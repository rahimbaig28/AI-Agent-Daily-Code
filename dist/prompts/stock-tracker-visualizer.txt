Stock Tracker Visualizer
- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, datetime, csv, os, statistics, matplotlib.pyplot).
- Generate 200 days of synthetic stock data on startup: 5 fictional stocks (AAPL-like, TSLA-like, etc.) with daily prices starting at random $50-200, daily change -5% to +5% volatility, volume 1M-10M shares.
- Save/load data to 'stocks.json' in script directory for persistence across runs.
- Main CLI menu (keyboard-only, print-based UX):
  * (1) View **line chart** of all stocks (prices over time, legend, grid, title "Stock Prices Dec 2025").
  * (2) **Bar chart** of latest volumes (5 bars, blue/red by price change).
  * (3) **Scatter plot** price vs volume (all stocks, color by stock, trend hint).
  * (4) Stats table: avg price, volatility (stdev), top performer today.
  * (5) Simulate next day (update data, save).
  * (q) Quit.
- Auto-detect dark/light terminal theme: use plt.style.use('dark_background') if os.environ.get('TERM') contains 'dark' or runtime env suggests dark (check simple contrast test).
- All charts: figsize=(12,8), save as PNG ('chart1.png' etc.) + plt.show(block=False); clear after 10s with input("Press Enter...").
- ARIA-like accessibility: print textual summaries of charts (e.g. "AAPL up 2.3%, peak $152") before/after plots for screen readers.
- Error handling: graceful fail on file issues, validate inputs (1-5,q only).
- Seed randomness with 79447 for reproducible demo data.
- Under 800 LOC total, testable: run generates data/view charts/simulates days.
