Invoice Organizer Pro

- Single-file Python 3 script using ONLY standard library (os, sys, json, pathlib, datetime, shutil, curses, collections).
- Keyboard-first TUI using curses: arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select/open, 'n' new invoice, 'd' delete, 'e' edit, 's' sort, 'q' quit, '?' help.
- Saves all data to invoices.json in script directory (list of dicts: {"id":int, "date":str, "client":str, "amount":float, "status":str, "notes":str}).
- Main screen: table view showing ID, Date, Client, Amount, Status (Unpaid/Paid/Overdue); highlight with arrows, press Enter for details.
- Detail view: shows full info, edit fields with Tab to cycle (date YYYY-MM-DD, client name, amount decimal, status dropdown, notes multiline), Esc to save&return.
- Auto-calculate totals: screen footer shows unpaid total, overdue count (overdue = unpaid and date > 30 days ago).
- Sort: 's' cycles Date desc/asc, Client alpha, Amount desc, Status; persists sort preference in config.json.
- New invoice: auto-assign next ID, today's date, quick-entry mode.
- Delete: confirm with 'y', moves to invoices_archive/ folder instead of hard delete.
- Drag-drop simulation: copy-paste client names between invoices using 'c' copy 'p' paste (clipboard via temp file).
- Persistence: auto-save every change, load on startup, handle missing files gracefully.
- Help overlay: '?' shows full key bindings with curses popup.
- Error handling: validate dates/amounts, show curses message boxes for errors.
- Compact: full app <800 lines, runs in terminal 80x24+, colors for status (red overdue, green paid).
