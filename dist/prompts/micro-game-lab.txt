Micro Game Lab

- Build a single-file web app that hosts a collection of tiny, self-contained micro games (e.g., memory match, tic-tac-toe, number guess, or a simple puzzle).
- Each game is accessible via a navigation menu and uses the URL hash to persist the current game and its state (e.g., #memory, #tictactoe).
- All games must be playable with keyboard and mouse, and UI elements must be ARIA-compliant for accessibility.
- Include a persistent undo/redo button for each game that supports reverting or reapplying the last move or action.
- Games must save their state in localStorage so progress is retained between sessions.
- The app should have a clean, responsive design with inline CSS and no external libraries.
- Add a share button for each game that copies the current game’s URL (with hash) to the clipboard for easy sharing.
- Ensure all games are contained in a single HTML file with inline JavaScript and CSS.
