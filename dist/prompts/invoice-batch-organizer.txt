Invoice Batch Organizer

- Single-file Python 3 script using ONLY standard library (os, sys, json, csv, datetime, pathlib, argparse).
- Shebang: #!/usr/bin/env python3
- Saves all data to single JSON file "invoices.json" in script directory with automatic backup.
- Core functionality: Manage small business invoices in terminal with keyboard-driven menu.
- Main menu (loop until quit): 1=Add Invoice, 2=List Invoices, 3=Search by date/client, 4=Export CSV, 5=Delete invoice, 6=Quit.
- Add Invoice: Prompt for client name, amount (float), date (YYYY-MM-DD or today), description (multi-line); auto-generate sequential invoice ID; save to JSON.
- List Invoices: Table format showing ID, client, amount, date (sorted newest first); total sum at bottom; page through if >20 items (Enter/Arrow keys).
- Search: Filter by partial client name OR date range (prompt start/end dates); show matching table.
- Export CSV: Write filtered/all invoices to "invoices_export_YYYYMMDD.csv" with columns: ID,Client,Amount,Date,Description.
- Delete: Select by ID from list; confirm before remove; backup JSON first.
- Data structure: List of dicts with keys ['id', 'client', 'amount', 'date', 'description']; validate inputs (amount>0, valid date).
- Keyboard UX: All operations use numbered menus; support Enter to select, Q to quit any screen, arrow keys for paging.
- Persistence: Load JSON on start (create if missing); auto-save after every change; backup as "invoices.json.bak".
- Error handling: Validate all inputs; handle missing/corrupt JSON gracefully; colored output using ANSI (green success, red error).
- Testable features:
  * Add 3 sample invoices on first run.
  * Export produces valid CSV openable in Excel.
  * Search "2026-02" finds February invoices.
  * Total calculation accurate to 2 decimals.
- Argparse: --export to auto-export and quit; --add "client amount date desc" for batch add.
- Keep under 800 lines: Compact table printing with fixed-width columns; no external deps.
