Habit Tracker Pro

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS, no external dependencies, under 1000 lines total.
- Dark/light theme toggle via button (persists in localStorage), default to system preference.
- Main grid: 7 daily habit slots (Mon-Sun), each with checkbox, editable habit name input, and progress circle (SVG).
- **Keyboard-first UX**: Tab navigation through all inputs/checkboxes/buttons; Enter to toggle checkboxes or submit new habit; Arrow keys to navigate days; Ctrl+Z/Y for undo/redo (stack-based, up to 50 actions).
- **ARIA-compliant**: role="grid" for habit grid, aria-labels on inputs/buttons, live regions for announcements (e.g., "Habit completed"), focus-visible styles.
- Add habit: Input at top, Enter adds to selected day, duplicates prevented.
- Stats footer: Streak counter (current/max), weekly completion %, reset week button (confirms via dialog).
- Persistence: All data (habits, completions, theme, undo stack) saved to localStorage on change, auto-loads on init.
- Responsiveness: Mobile-first CSS grid/flex, touch-friendly (40px+ tap targets), scales to desktop.
- Undo/redo: Tracks add/edit/toggle/reset actions; redo reverts forward.
- Testable features: Load→add habit Mon "Meditate"→check→theme toggle→Ctrl+Z→verify undo→week reset→confirm streak 0.
- Smooth animations: CSS transitions for checkmarks/progress, no JS libs needed.
- Export: Button downloads JSON of all data for backup.
