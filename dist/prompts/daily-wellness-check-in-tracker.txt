Daily Wellness Check-In Tracker

A single-file web app for logging daily mental and physical wellness metrics with journaling, trend visualization, and offline persistence.

- Core Purpose: Users log daily wellness across 5 dimensions (mood, energy, sleep quality, stress level, exercise minutes) with optional journal notes. App displays weekly trend charts and identifies patterns.

- Data Model: Each entry stores timestamp, five numeric scores (1-10 scale), journal text, and a user-generated tag (e.g., "work stress", "good sleep"). All data persists to localStorage as JSON.

- Features:
  - Quick-add form: Five sliders (or number inputs) + optional text area for notes + tag input. Submit button saves entry with current date.
  - Daily view: Shows today's entry (if exists) with edit button. Displays last 7 days as a simple line chart (mood and energy trends only).
  - Weekly summary: Aggregates averages for each metric. Shows highest/lowest days.
  - Tag filter: Users can filter entries by custom tags to spot correlations (e.g., "show entries tagged work stress").
  - Undo/Redo: Last 5 actions (add, edit, delete entry) can be undone/redone via buttons or keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y).
  - Print view: Clean, printer-friendly layout showing past 30 days as a table with metrics and notes.
  - Offline-first: All data stored locally; no backend required. Optional CSV export button.

- Accessibility & Keyboard:
  - Full keyboard navigation (Tab through form, Enter to submit, arrow keys to adjust sliders).
  - Labels linked to inputs. ARIA labels for chart regions.
  - High-contrast mode toggle.

- UI: Minimalist single-page layout with tab/button navigation (Today | Week | History | Print). Use calming color palette (soft blues/greens). Responsive for mobile and desktop.

- Technical: Single HTML file with inline CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Use Chart.js via CDN for trend visualization. No external dependencies beyond Chart.js.
