QuickCapture Notes

- Build a single-file HTML web app for personal productivity: a note-taking tool with instant capture, editing, and organization.
- Notes are stored in browser localStorage for persistence; each note has a unique ID (use timestamp) and supports rich text (basic formatting via contenteditable).
- Interface: clean, mobile-friendly layout with a main notes list and a large editor area.
- Features:
  - Create new notes with a single click.
  - Edit any note directly in the list or in a dedicated editor view.
  - Delete notes with confirmation.
  - Search/filter notes by title or content.
  - Undo/redo actions (store up to 10 history states per note).
  - Print-friendly view (button to toggle a print-optimized layout, hiding UI controls).
  - ARIA roles and keyboard navigation: all actions accessible via keyboard, screen reader friendly.
- No external libraries or dependencies; all CSS and JS must be inline.
- Export all notes as a downloadable HTML file (single click, preserves formatting).
- Import notes from an uploaded HTML file (overwrite current notes).
- Responsive design: works on desktop and mobile screens.
