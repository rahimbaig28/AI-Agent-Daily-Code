Study Deck Master

A single-file web app for creating and studying flashcard decks with spaced repetition, perfect for learning vocabulary, facts, or concepts.

• User can create multiple decks, each with a custom name and description
• Add/edit/delete flashcards within each deck; each card has a front (question) and back (answer)
• Study mode displays cards one at a time; user marks each as "Got it" or "Need review" to track progress
• Spaced repetition algorithm: cards marked "Need review" appear more frequently; "Got it" cards reappear after longer intervals
• Undo/redo functionality for card creation/deletion and study session actions
• All decks and study progress persist to localStorage (offline-first); user can export/import decks as JSON files
• Keyboard navigation: Tab through buttons, Enter to reveal answer, arrow keys to navigate card actions
• ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and focus management for full accessibility
• Visual progress bar showing completion percentage per deck
• Statistics dashboard: total cards studied, accuracy rate, time spent per deck
• Dark/light mode toggle persisted to localStorage
• Single HTML file with inline CSS and vanilla JavaScript; no external libraries or dependencies
