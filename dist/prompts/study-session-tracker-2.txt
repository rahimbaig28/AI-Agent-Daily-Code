Study Session Tracker

• Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, datetime, argparse, pathlib)
• Tracks study sessions with subject, duration (minutes), date, and optional notes
• Persistent storage: sessions saved to a local JSON file in the script's directory
• Undo/redo functionality: maintain a history stack (max 50 actions) for add, edit, delete operations
• Commands: add session, list sessions (filtered by subject/date range), delete session, edit session, show stats (total hours per subject, longest streak), undo, redo, export to CSV
• Print-friendly view: generate a formatted text report with session summary, sortable by subject or date
• Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Z for undo, Ctrl+Y for redo (when applicable in CLI context)
• Statistics dashboard: display daily/weekly/monthly study totals, average session length, most-studied subject
• Search/filter: find sessions by subject name, date range, or minimum duration
• Data validation: reject negative durations, invalid dates, empty subjects
• Accessibility: clear menu prompts, numbered options, plain-text output for screen readers
• No external dependencies; runs with `python3 study_tracker.py` plus optional arguments for batch operations
