Research Note Vault
- Single-file HTML app with inline CSS and JS only; no external libraries or dependencies.
- Dark theme optimized for late-night research sessions (inspired by 2025-12-16T04:34 UTC seed).
- Core UI: Fullscreen editor with markdown preview pane (split 60/40), sticky top toolbar, and bottom status bar.
- **Note creation**: Keyboard-first UX - Cmd/Ctrl+N for new note; auto-saves to localStorage every 5s with title extraction from first H1 or 20 chars.
- **Note library**: Sidebar (toggle with Cmd/Ctrl+B) shows card list of saved notes (title, last edited timestamp, word count); click to load.
- **Drag-and-drop**: Drag files (text/PDF/images) onto editor to append content; images as dataURL embeds, text extracted via FileReader.
- **Keyboard nav**: Arrow keys cycle notes, Enter opens, Cmd/Ctrl+S manual save, Cmd/Ctrl+E toggle edit/preview, Tab focus management with visible focus rings.
- **Markdown support**: Live preview renders bold/italic/lists/headings/links/codeblocks/images; toolbar buttons for H1-H3, bold, italic, list, link.
- **Search**: Cmd/Ctrl+F searches all notes (fuzzy match titles/content); highlights results in library.
- **Export/Import**: Toolbar buttons: Export all notes as single JSON (download via Blob), Import JSON via file picker (drag-drop zone in settings modal).
- **Persistence**: localStorage for notes (array of {id, title, content, timestamp, wordcount}); max 100 notes with LRU eviction warning.
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels on all interactive elements, screen-reader friendly note cards, high-contrast mode toggle, keyboard trap in modals.
- **Responsive**: Mobile stacks preview below editor; touch drag-drop support.
- **Polish**: Smooth transitions (CSS), loading spinner for large imports, undo stack (Cmd/Ctrl+Z up to 50 steps), auto-title on first save.
- Testable features: Create 5 notes, drag text file, search "research", export/import JSON, verify persistence after refresh.
