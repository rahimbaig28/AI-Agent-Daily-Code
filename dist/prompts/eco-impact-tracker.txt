Eco Impact Tracker

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS (no external libraries or files).
- **Core feature**: Track personal carbon footprint from daily activities (transport, energy, food, waste).
- Activity categories with sliders: Driving (km), Flights (km), Electricity (kWh), Meat meals (daily), Plastic waste (items/week).
- Real-time **carbon score** calculation (kg CO2e) using fixed multipliers: car=0.2kg/km, flight=0.25kg/km, electricity=0.5kg/kWh, meat=2kg/meal, plastic=0.1kg/item.
- Daily/weekly total with **progress bar** toward 0-100 scale (green <20kg/day, yellow 20-50, red >50).
- **Persistence**: Save data to localStorage; auto-load on refresh; clear/reset button.
- **Auto dark/light theme**: Detect prefers-color-scheme; toggle switch; persist preference in localStorage.
- **Share via URL hash**: Encode current scores in window.location.hash (e.g., #drive:50|flight:0|...); auto-parse/load on page load.
- **Print-friendly view**: Print button triggers @media print CSS (hide UI, show summary table with scores/totals; black text, no backgrounds).
- Keyboard accessible: Tab navigation, Enter/Space for inputs/buttons, arrow keys for sliders, Escape to close any modals.
- Responsive design: Mobile-first grid; works on desktop/tablet/phone.
- Visuals: Earth icon emoji, gradient backgrounds (green/blue light, dark green/black dark), animated score updates.
- Input validation: Sliders 0-500 range, round to integers, prevent NaN.
- Testable: Load with hash #drive:100|energy:10 shows pre-filled; toggle theme persists; print shows clean table; localStorage saves across tabs.
