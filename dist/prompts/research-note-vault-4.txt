Research Note Vault
- Single-file Python 3 script using ONLY standard library (json, os, datetime, collections, hashlib, urllib.parse, webbrowser)
- Persistent storage in ~/research_notes.json with notes containing title, content, tags (comma-separated), and timestamp
- Command-line interface with keyboard-first UX: support arrow keys (↑↓ for navigate, ←→ for tag toggle), Enter (add/edit), 'd' (delete), 'u' (undo), 'r' (redo), 's' (search), 'q' (quit)
- Undo/redo stack (max 50 actions) tracking add/edit/delete operations on notes
- Live search: type to filter notes by title/content/tags, press Enter to clear
- Tag management: Ctrl+T to toggle tag filter, shows/hides notes matching any selected tag
- Share feature: 'x' exports current note as markdown to clipboard (print base64 for manual decode) + generates shareable hash (title+tags hashed) for URL param (?note=hash)
- Import via hash: run with --load=HASH to auto-load matching note for editing/sharing
- Notes list displays: #id | title | tags | date (short), arrow to select
- Edit mode: simple line editor for title/content/tags, supports ↑↓ history within field
- Auto-save every 30s and on quit, graceful crash recovery from partial writes
- Stats bar: "N notes | T tags | S search | U/R undo/redo stack"
- Testable features: create 5 notes with tags "ml,data,stats"; undo delete; search "ml"; share hash loads correct note
- Shebang #!/usr/bin/env python3, run as ./vault.py or python vault.py
