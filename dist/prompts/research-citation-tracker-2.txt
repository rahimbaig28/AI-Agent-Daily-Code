Research Citation Tracker
- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS, no external dependencies, fully offline-first using localStorage.
- Auto-detects system dark/light theme preference via prefers-color-scheme, with manual toggle button; persists choice in localStorage.
- Main interface: Sticky header with title, theme toggle (sun/moon icons), "New Citation" button, and search input.
- Central content area uses card-based grid layout: each citation as a clickable card showing author/year/title snippet; empty state shows "No citations yet – add your first!" with icon.
- Add citation modal (backdrop overlay): Form fields for Author, Year (number input), Title, URL, Notes (textarea); keyboard-accessible (Tab/Esc/Enter); validates required fields; saves to localStorage as JSON array.
- Card actions: Click expands to full details view; Edit/Delete buttons; keyboard nav (Arrow keys move focus, Enter selects).
- Search filters cards in real-time by any field (case-insensitive); clears on empty input.
- Share feature: Generates compact URL hash encoding all citations (JSON minified + base64); loads from hash on page load/URL change; updates hash automatically on changes.
- Data persistence: All citations stored in localStorage as JSON array; auto-saves on every change; loads on init with fallback to empty.
- Sorting: Dropdown in header for "Newest First", "Author A-Z", "Year Desc"; persists in localStorage.
- Accessibility: ARIA labels/roles on all interactive elements; high-contrast cards; focus-visible styles; screen-reader friendly empty states and modals.
- Responsive: Mobile-first grid (1-col mobile, 2-4 col desktop); touch-friendly buttons (>44px).
- Export/Import: Buttons to download citations as JSON file; file input to upload/merge JSON.
- Testable features: Add 3 citations, search "author name", toggle theme, share URL and verify restore, sort by year, delete one, confirm persistence after refresh.
