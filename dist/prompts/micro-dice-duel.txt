Micro Dice Duel
- Single-file Python 3 script using ONLY standard library (random, os, json, sys, curses for TUI).
- Two-player **dice dueling game** (keyboard-first UX): Player 1 (WASD keys) vs Player 2 (arrow keys) on 20x10 grid.
- Each turn: Select position with keys, roll 1-6 dice (random.randint), place highest die value; goal: surround opponent's "king" (starts center).
- **Keyboard controls**: WASD/arrows move cursor (blinking highlight), SPACE rolls/places die, ENTER passes turn, P prints score grid to console/stdout (print-friendly).
- Visual TUI with curses: Grid shows dice values (numbers/chars), HP bars (kings lose 1HP per surrounded side), turn indicator, score (total dice value).
- **Persistence**: Saves game state to dice_duel.json (grid, HP, turn, cursor pos); auto-loads on start, saves after each turn; --new flag clears.
- Drag-like mechanic: Hold SPACE to "drag" cursor 1-3 spaces (max 3 dice per turn), release to place roll.
- Win conditions: Opponent's king HP=0; draw after 50 turns.
- Testable features: python dice_duel.py (load/continue), python dice_duel.py --new (fresh game), python dice_duel.py --print (dump grid).
- CLI args: --help shows usage; ESC quits safely saving state.
- Responsive: 60 FPS loop, clear screen each update, accessible colors (high contrast), arrow/WASD symmetry.
- Under 800 LOC: Compact curses grid (20x10 chars), simple collision/adjacency checks (king surround = 4+ adjacent own dice).
