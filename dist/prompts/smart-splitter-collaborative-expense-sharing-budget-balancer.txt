Smart Splitter: Collaborative Expense Sharing & Budget Balancer

- Single-file web app (one HTML file with inline CSS and JS; no external libraries).
- Users can add multiple participants by name and assign expenses specifying payer, amount, date, category, and optional description.
- Automatically calculate each participant’s net balance, showing who owes whom to settle debts fairly.
- Support drag-and-drop reordering of participants and expenses for easy organization.
- Expense data and participant info persist locally using localStorage.
- Provide export and import of all app data as JSON files to facilitate backup, sharing, and restoring.
- Auto-detect and switch between light and dark themes based on system preferences.
- Accessible keyboard navigation: tab order logical, forms fully operable via keyboard, and ARIA roles/labels for screen readers.
- Responsive layout for usability on desktop and mobile screens.
- Include a summary dashboard showing total expenses, per-category spending, and per-person balance in a clear, concise format.
- Validate user input with inline feedback for required fields and correct numeric formats.
- Provide a reset option to clear all data with confirmation to prevent accidental loss.
