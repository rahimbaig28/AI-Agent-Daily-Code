Debt Forecaster
- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, datetime, os, statistics, sys).
- Saves all data to 'debt_forecast.json' in current directory; auto-creates if missing.
- Main menu loop: 1) Add debt, 2) Update payment, 3) Forecast payoff dates, 4) View summary, 5) Export CSV, 6) Quit.
- Debts stored as list of dicts: {'name': str, 'principal': float, 'apr': float (annual %), 'min_payment': float, 'start_date': str (YYYY-MM-DD)}.
- Add debt: Prompt for name, principal, APR (e.g. 0.18 for 18%), min payment, auto-set start_date to today; validate inputs (>0).
- Update payment: List debts by index, select one, input new min_payment.
- Forecast: For each debt, simulate monthly payments (daily compound interest), calculate months-to-payoff and total interest using iterative loop (max 360 months); display table with name, balance, monthly payment, est. payoff date, total interest.
- Summary: Show current total debt, avg APR, total min payment; sort debts by payoff time.
- Export CSV: Write summary table to 'debt_export.csv' with columns: Name, Principal, APR, Min Payment, Est Payoff, Total Interest.
- Handle edge cases: zero balance (mark paid), invalid inputs (retry), empty file (start fresh).
- Use print tables with '-' borders for readability; keyboard-only (no GUI).
- Testable: Run script, add 3 debts (e.g. CreditCard $5000 18% $150, Loan $2000 8% $100, Auto $10000 5% $300), forecast, verify payoff dates ~2-5 years, export CSV.
