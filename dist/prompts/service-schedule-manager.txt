Service Schedule Manager

• Single-file HTML web app for small service businesses (plumbers, electricians, cleaners) to manage daily appointments and client contacts.

• Core Features:
  - Add, edit, delete service appointments with time, client name, phone, service type, and hourly rate
  - Daily view with chronological appointment list; toggle to weekly calendar grid view
  - Calculate total billable hours and revenue per day
  - Mark appointments as completed, no-show, or pending
  - Client contact quick-reference sidebar (name, phone, last service date)

• Data Persistence & Sharing:
  - All data stored in browser localStorage (survives refresh)
  - Export appointments as JSON file (downloadable backup)
  - Import JSON file to restore or merge data
  - Share schedule via URL hash encoding (copy/paste link to share current day's schedule)

• Keyboard-First UX:
  - Tab navigation through all controls
  - Enter to add/save appointment, Delete key to remove
  - Arrow keys to navigate between appointments
  - Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+E to export, Ctrl+I to import, Ctrl+D for daily view, Ctrl+W for weekly view
  - Screen reader friendly with semantic HTML and ARIA labels

• Design & Layout:
  - Minimalist two-column layout: appointments list (left), client sidebar (right)
  - Clean typography, high contrast for readability
  - Responsive: stacks on mobile, side-by-side on desktop
  - No external libraries; vanilla JavaScript only

• Additional Features:
  - Search/filter appointments by client name or service type
  - Time validation (no overlapping appointments)
  - Notes field for special instructions per appointment
  - Dark mode toggle (preference stored in localStorage)
