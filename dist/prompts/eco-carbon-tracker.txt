Eco Carbon Tracker

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS, no external dependencies.
- **Core feature**: Track personal daily carbon footprint from transport, energy, food, waste categories.
- Responsive grid layout: 12-column CSS Grid, mobile-first (stacked cards on <768px, 2-4 columns desktop).
- Input form per category: sliders/numbers for values (km driven, kWh used, meals out, etc.) with live CO2e calculation using fixed multipliers (car:0.2kg/km, electricity:0.5kg/kWh, beef meal:5kg, etc.).
- **Daily total** displays in large central metric with color-coded gauge (green<10kg, yellow<20kg, red>20kg daily).
- **History grid**: Add current day to grid via "Log Day" button; shows past 30 days as clickable cards with date/total/edit.
- Persistence: localStorage saves history array as JSON; auto-load on start.
- **Undo/Redo**: Ctrl+Z/Y (or buttons) for last 50 actions (state stack in JS array); actions include log/edit/delete.
- **Share via URL hash**: Encode current day data as base64 in #hash; load/parse on page load to auto-fill form.
- Keyboard nav: Tab through inputs/buttons, Enter to log, Arrow keys on grid to select/edit day.
- Visuals: Earth-toned palette (#2E7D32 green, #4CAF50 accent), icons via Unicode (🚗⚡🍖♻️), subtle animations (fade-in on log).
- Stats panel: Weekly/monthly avg below grid, trend arrow (up/down/flat vs prior).
- Reset data button (confirm dialog), export CSV via data:URL download.
- ARIA labels, focus outlines, high-contrast mode via prefers-contrast media query.
- Max 900 lines code: efficient JS (no frameworks), CSS Grid/Flexbox only.
