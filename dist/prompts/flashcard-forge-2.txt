Flashcard Forge
- Single-file Python 3 script using ONLY standard library (json, os, datetime, random, sys, argparse).
- CLI flashcard app for spaced repetition learning: create, study, review decks.
- Data persistence: store decks as JSON in ~/flashcard_forge.json (create if missing).
- Core commands via argparse:
  * python flash.py add DECK "front" "back" -- Add card to DECK (e.g., "vocab", "math").
  * python flash.py study DECK -- Interactive study: show front, input answer (Enter=show back), rate 0-5 (0=never, 5=perfect).
  * python flash.py list -- List all decks and card counts.
  * python flash.py stats DECK -- Show stats: total cards, due today, success rate.
- Spaced repetition algorithm:
  * Each card tracks: front, back, last_review (ISO datetime), interval_days (starts 1), easiness (starts 2.5), reviews (0).
  * Due cards: last_review + interval_days <= today.
  * On review: easiness = max(1.3, easiness + (0.1 - (5-rating)*0.08*(5-easiness)); interval = interval * easiness (min 35 days max).
  * Study prioritizes due cards first, then random non-due.
- Interactive study loop: clear screen (os.system('cls||clear')), show 10 cards/session or until quit ('q').
- Keyboard-first: single-key ratings (0-5,q), Enter to flip, printable ASCII table for stats.
- Error handling: validate inputs, backup JSON on corruption, help text for all commands.
- Example usage: python flash.py add vocab "hello" "bonjour"; python flash.py study vocab.
- Keep under 800 LOC: compact functions, no classes, inline data structures.
