Literature Gap Finder
- Single Python 3 script using only standard library (json, os, re, urllib.request, webbrowser, subprocess).
- CLI research utility: input paper title or DOI, finds related papers, identifies common topics, highlights underrepresented research gaps.
- Features:
  * Command-line interface with argparse: python app.py --doi "10.1234/abc" or --title "Machine Learning Survey".
  * Fetches abstracts from arXiv/CrossRef/Semantic Scholar using urllib (parse responses with re).
  * Uses difflib and collections.Counter to analyze topic overlap from keywords/extracted phrases.
  * Outputs ranked list of 5-10 potential gaps (e.g., "No papers on X in Y context") to terminal.
  * Persistence: saves searches/gaps to 'literature_gaps.json' with timestamps.
  * Testable: --demo flag loads sample data, shows gaps without network.
  * Keyboard shortcuts: 'o' to open top gap papers in browser via webbrowser.
  * Help: --help shows usage; interactive mode with 'q' to quit.
- Data flow: input -> fetch/parse 5-10 related abstracts -> extract keywords -> compute gap scores -> store/display.
- Error handling: offline mode uses cached data; graceful failures for bad DOIs.
- Keep under 800 lines: simple regex parsing, no ML/heavy computation.
