Micro Match Rush

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and vanilla JS (no external libraries or scripts).
- ARIA-compliant game board: 4x4 grid of cards (8 unique pairs) using role="grid", aria-labels, aria-live for announcements.
- Core gameplay: Memory matching micro-game; click to flip cards (max 2 at once), match pairs to win; 60-second timer with auto-reset on win/loss.
- Drag-and-drop reordering: Grab any card (draggable=true) to rearrange grid positions via HTML5 Drag API; updates board state instantly.
- Stats display: Moves counter, matches found, best time (persistent via localStorage); keyboard nav (Tab/arrow keys to select, Enter/space to flip).
- Controls: Play/pause button (aria-pressed), New Game button; responsive design (mobile-friendly grid, touch/drag support).
- Export/Import: "Export JSON" button downloads game state (stats + board) as file; "Import JSON" uses hidden file input with drag-drop zone for upload.
- Visuals: Clean CSS grid layout, flip animations (transform: rotateY), color-coded pairs, high-contrast theme; confetti burst on win via CSS particles.
- Accessibility: Screen reader announces flips/matches/timer ("Card 3 flipped: red apple", "1 match found"), focusable cards with visible outlines.
- Persistence: localStorage saves high scores, best moves; auto-saves every 5s during play.
- Testable features: Win in under 20 moves, export/import mid-game, drag to shuffle, keyboard-only playthrough, responsive on 320px width.
- Total impl <800 LOC: Modular JS (initGame(), handleFlip(), handleDrag(), saveState(), loadState()).
