Habit Grid Tracker

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS only; no external dependencies.
- Responsive grid layout: 7x4 grid (days x weeks) showing current week + past 3 weeks; adapts to mobile/desktop via CSS Grid/Flexbox.
- Core feature: Track daily habits (up to 8 customizable: e.g., "Exercise", "Read", "Meditate") with checkbox toggles per day.
- Add/edit habits: Modal form (input field + color picker for grid icons); persist via localStorage.
- Visual feedback: Filled circles/grid cells with habit color on check; streak counter per habit (current/max); weekly completion % in header.
- Share via URL hash: Encode habits + grid state in #hash; auto-load on page load/refresh; copy button generates shareable link.
- Keyboard support: Tab-focusable checkboxes/buttons; Enter to toggle habit cell; Escape closes modals; Arrow keys navigate grid.
- Print-friendly: @media print hides UI chrome (buttons/modals); scales grid to fit A4 with bold streaks/%; CSS page-break-inside: avoid.
- Productivity boosts: Today highlighter (current day cell glows); bulk-check yesterday/today buttons; reset week button; export JSON button (downloads data.txt).
- Dark/light mode toggle (persists in localStorage); high-contrast mode for accessibility (prefers-contrast media query).
- ARIA labels/roles: role="grid" on habit table; aria-checked on cells; live region for streak updates.
- Init with 4 default habits; seed random colors; max 500 chars habit names; under 1000 LOC total.
