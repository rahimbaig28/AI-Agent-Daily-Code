Cash Flow Forecaster
- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, datetime, os, csv, statistics, curses for TUI).
- Persistent data in 'cashflow.json' storing transactions as list of dicts: {'date': 'YYYY-MM-DD', 'amount': float, 'category': str, 'description': str}.
- Terminal UI with curses: full-screen responsive grid showing 7-day forecast, balance, income/expenses summary.
- Keyboard navigation: arrow keys/up-down to scroll transactions, Enter to edit/add, 's' to save, 'q' to quit, 'r' to refresh forecast.
- Main dashboard displays:
  - Current balance (sum all amounts).
  - 7-day cash flow forecast: average daily net (income - expenses) from last 30 days * 7 days.
  - Category spending table (top 5 categories by total).
  - Recent 10 transactions list.
- Add/edit transaction: prompt for date (default today), amount (+income/-expense), category (groceries, salary, rent, etc.), description.
- Forecast accuracy indicator: std dev of daily nets (low variance = reliable).
- Error handling: validate floats/dates, backup JSON on corruption.
- Accessibility: all actions keyboard-only, clear status messages at bottom.
- Share feature: generate URL-safe hash of current balance/forecast (base64 encode summary dict), print/copy to clipboard sim via print.
- Init: create JSON if missing, load sample data (3 incomes, 5 expenses).
- Keep under 800 lines: simple curses panels, no external deps.
