Eco Impact Tracker

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS (no external dependencies).
- Theme: Personal carbon footprint tracker for environment/sustainability.
- Responsive grid layout: 12-column CSS Grid, fluid breakpoints at 768px (tablet), 480px (mobile); adapts to all screen sizes.
- Header: App title "Eco Impact Tracker", tagline "Track your daily habits for a greener planet", current score badge (e.g., "215g CO2 today").
- Main content: Scrollable single-page with 4 sections (Home, Food, Transport, Tips) navigated via fixed top nav bar with smooth scroll links.
- Core feature: Habit input grid (4x3 responsive cards): Food (meals), Transport (trips), Energy (hours), Waste (items); each card has ARIA-compliant toggle buttons (e.g., "Veg Meal ✓", "Bike Ride ✓") with live CO2 calculation (predefined grams: veg=50g, car=200g, etc.).
- Real-time score: Central display updates total daily CO2 (target <500g), progress bar (green/yellow/red zones), weekly chart (Canvas bar graph, 7 days from localStorage).
- Persistence: localStorage saves daily/weekly data (JSON: {date: score, habits: []}); auto-loads on start, resets weekly.
- Extra features:
  - Print-friendly: @media print hides nav, fits grid to A4, black text/large fonts.
  - ARIA compliance: role="main/app", aria-labels on buttons/inputs, live regions for score updates (aria-live="polite"), keyboard nav (Tab/Enter/Space on toggles, Arrow keys on grid).
  - Responsive grid: Cards reflow 4-col desktop > 2-col tablet > 1-col mobile; touch-friendly 48px+ buttons.
- Tips section: Static sustainability facts (e.g., "Bike saves 150g CO2/km") in accordion (details/summary ARIA).
- Controls: Reset day button (confirm dialog), Export CSV (download link from JS-generated data).
- Styling: Clean green palette (#4CAF50 primary, #E8F5E8 bg), sans-serif font (system-ui), shadows for cards, animations (CSS transitions for toggles/progress).
- JS logic: Event listeners for inputs, sum CO2 on change, Chart.js-free Canvas chart, localStorage CRUD, window.matchMedia for responsiveness.
- Accessibility: Focus indicators, high contrast mode (@media prefers-contrast), screen reader friendly (semantic HTML5).
- Testable: Load app, toggle 5 habits (score=450g), check weekly persistence, resize/print, keyboard-only use.
