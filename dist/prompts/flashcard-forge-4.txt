Flashcard Forge
- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS, no external dependencies, fully offline-first.
- Core: Create, edit, delete **flashcards** with front (question) and back (answer) fields; use drag-and-drop to reorder deck.
- Deck management: Save multiple decks to localStorage with names; load/delete decks; auto-save changes every 10s.
- Study mode: Flip cards with Spacebar/click; mark correct/incorrect (Enter/N); track session stats (correct/total) shown in top-right.
- Drag-and-drop: Reorder cards in deck list; drop to move between decks if multiple loaded.
- UI: Clean card-based layout with grid of flashcards; large flip animation; sticky top nav (Add Card, Study Mode toggle, Deck selector).
- Theme: Auto-detect prefers-color-scheme for **dark/light mode**; manual toggle button persists in localStorage.
- Accessibility: Full keyboard nav (Tab/Arrows/Space/Enter/Esc); ARIA labels on cards/buttons; high-contrast text; screen-reader friendly flip states.
- Empty state: Friendly message "Drop notes here or click Add to start your first deck!" with icon.
- Progress upload: Drag text/PDF/HTML files to import as new cards (parse simple text splits on newlines).
- Responsive: Mobile-first, cards stack vertically <600px; touch-swipe to flip.
- Test features: Add 5 cards, reorder via drag, study 10 flips, switch themes, import text file, verify localStorage persists after refresh.
