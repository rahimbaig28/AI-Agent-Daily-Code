Wellness Habit Grid
- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS, no external libraries or assets.
- Responsive design: Mobile-first, 12-column CSS Grid layout that adapts to screen size (full-width on mobile, 3-col on tablet, 4-col on desktop).
- Core feature: Drag-and-drop grid of 25 customizable wellness habit tiles (e.g., "Drink Water", "Meditate 10min", "Walk 5k steps") covering categories like hydration, movement, mindfulness, nutrition.
- Users drag tiles from a sidebar palette (20 pre-defined + custom input) to grid cells; drop to activate habit for the day.
- Visual feedback: Active tiles glow green, show progress slider (0-100%, editable via click+drag), inactive tiles grayed out.
- Daily reset: Progress persists via localStorage; auto-reset grid at midnight (use Date.now() checks), with streak counter per tile (e.g., "3-day streak").
- Share via URL hash: Encode active tiles + progress as base64 hash on share button click; load/decode on page load if hash present.
- Keyboard support: Tab navigation, arrow keys for drag selection, Enter to toggle progress, Esc to cancel drag; ARIA labels for screen readers (role="grid", aria-labels on tiles).
- Progress summary: Top header shows total habits active, average progress %, longest streak; pie chart (SVG + Canvas) updates live.
- Input modal: Click "+" to add custom habit (text input, icon emoji picker from predefined list).
- Animations: Smooth CSS transitions for drag (transform: translate), progress fills (width animation), confetti burst (Canvas particles) on 100% daily goal.
- Persistence: Save grid state, streaks, customs to localStorage; load on init with fallback to demo grid.
- Testable features: Drag tile to grid → glows + progress bar; edit slider → updates pie; share URL → copy to clipboard; refresh → state persists; midnight sim (manual Date override) → resets.
- Style: Clean wellness theme (soft greens #4CAF50, blues #2196F3, rounded corners, 400px max tile size, sans-serif font).
- Max code: Under 1000 lines total (HTML<100, CSS<400, JS<500).
