A11y Helper Kit — single-file accessible utilities web app

- Purpose: Single-file HTML app that provides small, focused accessibility helpers for designers, content authors, and testers (contrast checker, text resizer, focus order visualizer, ARIA live region tester, keyboard navigation simulator, and shareable URL state).  
- File type: One HTML file with inline CSS and vanilla JS only (no external libraries).  
- UI layout: Responsive single-column panel; top toolbar with app title, mode toggle (light/dark/high-contrast), and share button; main area with a left vertical tab list of tools and a right content pane showing the active tool; footer with keyboard shortcuts and a print-friendly view button.  
- Tools (each implemented in the same page and accessible via tabs):
  - Contrast Checker: two color inputs (foreground/background) plus optional sample text; calculates WCAG 2.1 contrast ratio and shows pass/fail for normal and large text; exposes numeric ratio and recommended nearest accessible color (simple algorithm: adjust lightness in HSL until ratio passes). Keyboard and screen-reader accessible controls and live ARIA alert for result changes.  
  - Text Resizer & Line Length: sample paragraph with slider controls for font size (12–48px), line-height, and container width; shows current line length in characters (estimate) and provides presets (mobile, tablet, desktop). Changes update live and are announced via ARIA live region.  
  - Focus Order Visualizer: small editable test region where users can add focusable elements via a "+" button (buttons, links, inputs); a "Show Order" toggle overlays numbered badges on elements in DOM/tab order; keyboard shortcut (V) toggles visualization; respects reduced-motion preference.  
  - ARIA Live Region Tester: controls to send messages into an on-page aria-live="polite" and aria-live="assertive" region with selectable politeness, message type (info/warning), and message delay; shows how screen readers would receive updates (text-only representation).  
  - Keyboard Navigation Simulator: virtual keyboard panel to simulate Tab / Shift+Tab / Arrow navigation through the test region; highlights simulated currently focused element and logs navigation steps in an accessible list. Supports Home/End/PageUp/PageDown simulation keys.  
- Persistence: Save user settings (theme, last-selected tool, favorites, custom colors, and text-resizer presets) to localStorage and restore on load. Include explicit "Reset to defaults" button.  
- Share via URL hash: Serialize current tool state (tool id and parameters) into a compact JSON string encoded in the URL hash; opening the URL restores state. Provide a "Copy share link" button and short success/failure toast announced with ARIA.  
- Drag-and-drop: Users can drag a small external HTML snippet or image into the test region; the app will extract text and colors (if image, sample prominent color) and populate the Contrast Checker and sample content. Provide clear accessible instructions and accept paste as alternative.  
- Print-friendly view: Single-button "Print view" that opens a print-optimized layout of the currently active tool (high-contrast, simple fonts, large controls) and hides interactive-only UI; uses printable CSS media rules.  
- Accessibility requirements:
  - Full keyboard-only operation: all controls reachable via Tab, logical focus order, visible focus indicators, and ARIA labels where necessary. Provide skip-to-main and skip-to-tools links at top.  
  - ARIA roles and properties: use role="tablist"/"tab"/"tabpanel" for tabs, aria-live regions for announcements, aria-pressed for toggle buttons, and appropriate alerts for errors.  
  - Color and contrast: CSS variables for theme colors; ensure minimum contrast for UI elements per WCAG AA. Respect prefers-reduced-motion and prefers-contrast.  
  - Semantic HTML: use headings, lists, forms and buttons correctly; tool content must be usable with JS disabled for basic reading (progressive enhancement).  
  - Testing hints pane: small help area showing keyboard shortcuts (Tab, Shift+Tab, V for visualizer, C for contrast copy, P for print view) and notes on how to test with screen readers.  
- Performance and size: Keep DOM small and scripts optimized — single-file implementation intended to be under ~300KB minified; lazy-initialize heavier features (image color sampling) on first use.  
- Error handling & feedback: Inline validation for inputs (color codes), accessible error messages, and non-modal toasts that auto-dismiss and are announced via aria-live.  
- Implementation constraints: All CSS and JS must be inline in the single HTML file; do not use external fonts or assets. Use the Canvas API for image color sampling and the Clipboard API for copy/share. Use URL hash only (no server).  
- Deliverables for implementer: clear tab-to-tool mapping, data schema for URL hash (tool:id + params), localStorage keys list, keyboard shortcut map, and minimal CSS variable theme palette to meet contrast targets.
