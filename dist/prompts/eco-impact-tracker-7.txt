Eco Impact Tracker

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS only (no external libraries or assets).
- **Core purpose**: Track personal daily eco-actions (e.g., recycling, water saved, km biked) and calculate carbon offset score with sustainability tips.
- Responsive grid layout: 12-column CSS Grid for desktop/tablet/mobile; auto-adjusts to screen size (use media queries at 768px and 480px breakpoints).
- Auto dark/light theme: Detect prefers-color-scheme on load, toggle via button; persist choice in localStorage.
- **Main sections** (smooth scroll navigation with sticky top nav bar using anchor links):
  * Hero: App title, tagline "Track your green impact daily", current score badge.
  * Dashboard: Scrollable grid of stat cards (daily score, weekly total, monthly avg, CO2 saved in kg).
  * Tracker: Form to log actions – dropdown (Bike 5km, Recycle 1kg, etc.), quantity input (+/- buttons), date picker (default today); Add button appends to list.
  * History: Responsive grid list of past entries (date, action, value, impact points); delete/edit per item; filter by date range.
  * Tips: Dynamic list of 5-8 sustainability tips based on low-score categories (e.g., "Low transport: Try biking!").
- Data persistence: Use localStorage for entries array (JSON: [{date, action, quantity, points}]); auto-save on change, load on init.
- **Key interactions**:
  * Calculate points: Predefined impacts (e.g., bike km=10pts/km, recycle=5pts/kg); total score updates live.
  * Weekly/monthly aggregates computed on-the-fly from data.
  * Share via URL hash: Encode current dashboard stats as base64 hash (e.g., #score=150&week=3.2); parse on load to restore view.
- **Accessibility/keyboard**: ARIA labels on all interactive elements; full tab navigation (focus outlines); Enter to submit form/add; Escape to close modals; screen-reader friendly (live regions for score updates).
- Smooth animations: CSS transitions for theme toggle, card reveals, grid fades (max 0.3s duration).
- Performance: Lazy-load tip images via IntersectionObserver if used; under 1500 LOC total.
- Test features: Add 3 entries → verify score/history; toggle theme → persists; share hash → restores data view; resize → grid reflows; tab through all controls.
