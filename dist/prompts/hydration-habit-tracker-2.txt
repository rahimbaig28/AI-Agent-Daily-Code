Hydration Habit Tracker

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS (no external dependencies).
- **Core UI**: Clean, calming interface with ocean-blue/forest-green color scheme (#4A90E2 primary, #7ED321 accent). Fullscreen responsive layout for mobile/desktop.
- **Main display**: Large central water glass SVG animation (fills from 0-2000ml based on daily intake). Current intake counter (e.g., "1250 / 2000 ml") with percentage ring progress bar.
- **Daily goal**: User sets custom ml target (default 2000ml) via number input + Enter key. Persist in localStorage.
- **Logging**: Keyboard-first input: Tab-focusable "Log Sip" button (+250ml), "Log Glass" (+500ml), custom ml input field. Auto-save entries. Visual log as timeline of water droplets (click to edit/delete).
- **Keyboard UX**: Full navigation via Tab/Arrow keys. Enter to log/select. Escape to close modals. ARIA labels/roles for screen readers.
- **Undo/Redo**: Stack-based history (max 20 actions). Ctrl+Z (undo), Ctrl+Y (redo) shortcuts. Visual button pair in toolbar.
- **Stats view**: Toggle tab (Today/Week/Month) shows charts: ml/day line graph (Canvas API), streak counter, avg intake. Print-friendly mode (@media print: simplified black/white, no animations).
- **Print feature**: Ctrl+P triggers print-optimized view (stats + weekly summary table). CSS hides interactive elements.
- **Persistence**: localStorage for goals, logs (array of {date, ml, time}), stats cache. Auto-backup on changes.
- **Extras**: Motivational quotes rotation (10 wellness-themed). Gentle reminder notifications (if permission granted, every 2hrs if <50% goal). Dark mode toggle (prefers-color-scheme).
- **Edge cases**: Handle storage quota errors (fallback to sessionStorage). Reset day at midnight UTC. Data export as JSON/CSV button.
- **Performance**: <1000 LOC total. Smooth 60fps animations via requestAnimationFrame. No frameworks.
