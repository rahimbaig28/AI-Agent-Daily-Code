Accessibility Auditor Pro

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS only; no external libraries or dependencies.
- Purpose: Audit web pages for WCAG accessibility issues in real-time with instant fixes and reports.
- Core UI: Sticky top nav bar with buttons: "Scan Page", "Check Focus", "Generate Report", "Print View", "Share"; main area with card-based results grid; bottom status bar showing score (A-F).
- Scan feature: Button triggers audit of current page URL (use document.querySelectorAll for common issues); check 20 testable rules: color contrast (via getComputedStyle), alt text missing on images, ARIA roles absent on interactive elements, heading hierarchy (h1-h6 order), keyboard focusable elements count, no <title>, lang attr missing, empty links/buttons.
- Results display: Cards per issue type (e.g., "12 images missing alt"); severity badges (Critical, High, Medium, Low); fix button auto-applies inline styles/attributes where possible (e.g., add alt="image" via setAttribute); live preview toggle shows fixed vs original.
- Accessibility helpers: High-contrast mode toggle (CSS filter: contrast(1.5)); screen reader simulator (ARIA-live announcements for changes); resizable text slider (125%-200% via CSS font-size).
- Keyboard support: Full nav with Tab/arrow keys; Enter to activate buttons; Escape clears focus; Ctrl+Enter scans; ARIA labels/roles on all interactive elements; focus-visible styles.
- Undo/redo: Stack-based history (up to 50 states); Ctrl+Z/Y or buttons; persists in localStorage.
- Persistence: localStorage for scan history (last 10 URLs with scores/fixes), user settings (contrast, text size), default config.
- Share via URL hash: Encode current audit state (issues list, fixes applied) as base64 hash; load restores exact state; copy button generates shareable URL.
- Print-friendly view: Button switches to @media print styles; single-page report with issues table, score summary, fix checklist; no nav/JS elements.
- Responsive design: Mobile-first CSS grid; works on all screen sizes; touch-friendly buttons (44px min).
- Performance: Under 800 lines total; runs in <1s per scan; no infinite loops.
- Testable features: Load page, scan, verify 5+ issues found; apply fix, see DOM change; undo/redo cycles; share/load hash; print preview (Ctrl+P); keyboard-only flow passes audit.
