Pixel Puzzle Rush
- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS only, no external libraries or build steps.
- **Core game**: 4x4 pixel grid puzzle where players reveal pixels by typing letter sequences (A-Z) matching hidden patterns; 10 unique daily puzzles generated from seed 58497.
- **Game flow**: Start screen shows instructions and "Play Today" button; main game displays 16-pixel grid (200x200px total), current sequence input field, score (0-100), and timer (60s countdown).
- **Input mechanics**: Keyboard-first UX - type letters to guess sequence (e.g., "CATDOG"); Enter submits, Backspace deletes; correct sequence reveals 1-4 pixels with animation; wrong guess vibrates input and deducts 5s.
- **Win conditions**: Reveal all pixels before time runs out; perfect score (100pts) for full reveal under 30s; partial scores shown on game over screen with "New Game" button.
- **Persistence**: Save high score, best time, and completed puzzles to localStorage; load daily puzzle state on refresh; show 7-day streak counter.
- **Themes**: Auto-detect prefers-color-scheme for dark/light mode (dark: #1a1a1a bg, #00ff88 accents; light: #ffffff bg, #0066cc accents); toggle switch in header.
- **Print-friendly**: @media print styles hide interactive elements, show solved puzzle grid with score; "Print Puzzle" button triggers window.print().
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels on all buttons/grid cells (live region announces reveals/scores); high-contrast mode toggle; tab-focusable input/game controls; screen-reader friendly instructions.
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first grid scales 1.5x on touch devices; swipe gestures for mobile sequence input; sticky header with score/timer.
- **Polish**: Smooth pixel-reveal animation (0.2s scale/pop); confetti burst on win; subtle sound cues via Web Audio API (beep for correct, buzz for wrong); fullscreen toggle button.
- **Edge cases**: Prevent duplicate puzzle solves; graceful offline mode (cache puzzle in localStorage); reset all data button.
