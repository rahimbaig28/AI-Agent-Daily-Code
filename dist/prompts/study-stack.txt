Study Stack

- Build a single-file web app for creating, managing, and reviewing flashcard stacks for learning.
- Users can add, edit, and delete flashcards (each with a front and back).
- Support for multiple stacks; users can switch between stacks via a dropdown.
- Each stack is uniquely identified by a name and persists in localStorage.
- Implement undo/redo for recent stack edits (add, edit, delete).
- Allow sharing a stack via URL hash: visiting a URL with a stack hash loads and displays that stack.
- Offline-first: all data is stored in localStorage; no server required.
- Keyboard shortcuts: arrow keys to flip cards, Enter to add a new card, Delete to remove, Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y for undo/redo.
- Accessible: all actions available via keyboard; screen reader friendly.
- Responsive design: works on mobile and desktop.
- Testable features: create stack, add/edit/delete cards, switch stacks, undo/redo, share via URL, offline persistence.
