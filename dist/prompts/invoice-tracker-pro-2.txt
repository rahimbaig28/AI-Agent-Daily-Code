Invoice Tracker Pro

- Single-file HTML app with inline CSS and JS (no external dependencies).
- **Core purpose**: Track small business invoices with add/edit/delete, totals, and status management.
- **Responsive grid layout**: 12-column CSS Grid for desktop/tablet/mobile; invoice list as cards, form in sidebar on wide screens, stacked on mobile.
- **Data persistence**: Offline-first using localStorage; auto-save every 30s and on changes; load on startup.
- **Key features**:
  * Add invoice: Form with client name, amount (currency input), due date (date picker), status (dropdown: Draft/Paid/Overdue), notes.
  * List view: Scrollable grid of invoice cards showing client, amount, due date (color-coded: green=paid, red=overdue, yellow=due soon), status badge.
  * Edit/delete: Click card to edit inline, delete button with confirmation dialog.
  * Totals: Dashboard summary showing total due, paid, overdue amounts; pie chart using Canvas (simple 3-segment).
  * Filter/sort: Buttons/tabs for All/Draft/Paid/Overdue; sort by due date or amount.
  * Search: Live input to filter by client name or notes.
- **Share via URL hash**: Encode selected invoice ID or filter in hash; parse on load to restore view (e.g. #invoice/3 or #filter/overdue).
- **Keyboard accessibility**: Tab-focusable elements; Enter to save/add; Escape to cancel; Arrow keys navigate list; ARIA labels on all interactive elements.
- **UI/UX**:
  * Dark/light mode toggle (persisted in localStorage).
  * Smooth animations: Fade-in on load, slide for modals.
  * Mobile-first: Touch-friendly buttons (>44px), swipe to delete on list items.
  * Print/export: Button to print filtered list or single invoice (use window.print with print-only CSS).
- **Offline handling**: ServiceWorker-like via JS (cache-bust on load); show "Offline mode" banner if !navigator.onLine.
- **Data structure**: Array of objects {id: unique timestamp, client, amount: number, due: ISO date, status, notes}; validate inputs (amount>0, required fields).
- **Edge cases**: Handle empty state with helpful message; overdue calc: due < today; due-soon: within 7 days.
- **Constraints**: <800 lines total; vanilla JS only; CSS custom properties for theming; semantic HTML5.
