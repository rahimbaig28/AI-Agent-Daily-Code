Flashcard Forge

- Single-file Python 3 script using ONLY standard library (json, os, sys, random, datetime, readline, curses for TUI).
- Creates "flashcards.json" in script directory for persistence (deck storage).
- Main menu via curses TUI: 1) Add Card, 2) Study Session, 3) Edit Deck, 4) Delete Deck, 5) Quit.
- Add Card: readline input for front (question), back (answer), tag (optional); auto-save to JSON; supports keyboard nav (Enter, ESC).
- Study Session: Random shuffled cards from all/all-tags; flip with SPACEBAR; rate EASY/HARD/AGAIN (1-3 keys); tracks streak/session stats; keyboard-first (arrows navigate, Q quit).
- Edit Deck: List cards with indices, select by number to modify front/back/tag; DELETE removes card.
- Offline-first: All data in local JSON; no network required; handles missing file gracefully.
- Stats screen: Shows total cards, avg streak, hardest tags (sorted by failure rate).
- Keyboard shortcuts global: Ctrl+C safe quit, ? shows help overlay.
- Data format: JSON list of dicts {"front":str, "back":str, "tag":str, "streak":int=0, "last_seen":str}.
- Compact curses UI: Clean borders, color-coded (green=easy, red=hard), progress bar for sessions.
- Error handling: Validates inputs, backups JSON before edits, console fallback if curses fails.
- Testable: Run script, add 5 cards, study session scores >70% easy, edit changes persist after restart.
