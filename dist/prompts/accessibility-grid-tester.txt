Accessibility Grid Tester

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS, no external dependencies.
- Purpose: Test web layouts for WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance using a responsive grid simulator.
- Main interface: Fullscreen responsive grid (CSS Grid) with 12 draggable/resizable panels representing common UI sections (header, nav, main, sidebar, footer, cards).
- Drag-and-drop: Use HTML5 Drag API to rearrange panels; panels snap to grid lines with live visual feedback (grid overlay toggle).
- Resize handles on panel corners (mouse/touch/keyboard); constrain to 4px grid increments.
- Accessibility testing features:
  - Toggle **contrast checker**: Sample colors from panels, compute WCAG contrast ratios, display PASS/FAIL badges with AA/AAA thresholds.
  - **Focus order simulator**: Keyboard navigation mode (Tab/Shift+Tab); highlight current focus with outline, show logical order numbers.
  - **Screen size presets**: Buttons for mobile (320px), tablet (768px), desktop (1200px); auto-adjust grid.
  - **Color picker**: Click any panel to extract dominant color (Canvas API), suggest accessible alternatives.
- Keyboard support: Arrow keys for nudging panels (1px/4px modes), Tab for full navigation, Enter/Esc for interactions, Ctrl+Space toggle modes.
- Persistence: Save grid state, positions, colors as JSON to localStorage; auto-load on refresh.
- Export/Import: Buttons to download current config as JSON file, upload JSON via drag-and-drop or file input to restore.
- Responsive: Fluid layout adapts to any viewport; use viewport units and media queries.
- Visual feedback: Subtle animations (CSS transitions), high-contrast mode toggle, ARIA labels/roles on all interactive elements.
- Reset button to default layout; info modal (ARIA dialog) explaining WCAG rules tested.
- Performance: Under 800 LOC; throttle resize/drag events to 60fps.
