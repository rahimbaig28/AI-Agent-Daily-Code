Flashcard Forge

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS (no external libraries or dependencies)
- ARIA-compliant flashcard study app for spaced repetition learning
- Main screen shows deck title, card count, and current card (question front by default)
- Flip card with SPACEBAR, CLICK, or swipe gesture (touchstart/touchend for mobile)
- Keyboard support: SPACE/ENTER (flip), ARROW LEFT (previous), ARROW RIGHT (next), 'E' (easy), 'H' (hard)
- Buttons for "Easy" (rate 5, long interval), "Hard" (rate 1, short interval), with ARIA labels and roles
- Drag-and-drop reordering: grab cards with mouse/touch, drag to new position, drop zones highlight
- Add cards via modal form (question, answer fields, Enter to save), ESC to close
- Deck persists in localStorage as JSON array: {question, answer, rating, nextReviewDate, position}
- Spaced repetition algorithm: next review = today + (rating * 1-5 days), sort by soonest first
- Share deck via URL hash: encode deck JSON in base64, decode on load, update hash on changes
- Progress stats: cards due today/total, streak counter, avg rating display
- Responsive design: mobile-first, cards scale 80vw max, swipe works on touch devices
- Dark mode toggle (system preference + button), smooth CSS transitions for flips/drags
- Testable features: create deck "Capitals", add 3 cards, rate 2 easy/1 hard, verify sorting by due date, share URL loads same deck
- Accessibility: role="application", aria-live for feedback, focus management, high contrast mode support
