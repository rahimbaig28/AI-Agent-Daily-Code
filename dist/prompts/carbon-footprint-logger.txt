• ARIA labels on all form controls; role="list" and role="listitem" for activity cards; semantic HTML (button, input, section elements).
• Visual progress bar showing emissions relative to a weekly target (default 50 kg CO₂).
• Color-coded activity categories (transport=blue, energy=green, food=orange, shopping=red).
• Summary stats: highest-emission activity type, daily average, carbon saved vs. baseline.
