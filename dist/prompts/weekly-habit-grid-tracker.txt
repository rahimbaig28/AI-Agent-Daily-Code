Weekly Habit Grid Tracker

- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, os, datetime, curses for TUI).
- Creates 'habits.json' file for persistence in current directory; auto-creates if missing.
- Displays 7x7 responsive grid: 7 days (Mon-Sun) x 7 customizable habits (e.g., "Exercise", "Read 30min").
- Use WASD/arrow keys for navigation: W/up selects habit row, A/left D/right selects day column.
- SPACE toggles habit completion for selected cell (green filled ✓, white empty).
- 'N' prompts for new habit name (max 12 chars) to replace selected row.
- 'C' clears all completions for selected habit row.
- 'U' undo (reverts last toggle/clear action), 'R' redo (up to 50 actions stored in memory).
- 'P' enters print-friendly view: clears screen, renders ASCII grid with borders/summary, pauses for copy/print.
- 'S' saves to JSON (auto-saves on quit too), 'Q' quits gracefully.
- Top status bar shows: current date range (week starting Monday), selected habit/day, items completed/total, undo stack size.
- On startup: loads habits/completions or initializes with defaults; advances week if current week changed.
- Keyboard-only, accessible with clear key hints at bottom; handles resize with curses.
- Testable: run script, add habit "Test", toggle cells, undo/redo, save/load, print view.
