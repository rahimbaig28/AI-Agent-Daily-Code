QuickCite Research Assistant

- Build a single-file web app for researchers to quickly capture, organize, and share citation snippets.
- The app must work offline and persist data in localStorage.
- Users can add citation snippets (title, author, year, notes) via a form.
- Each snippet is displayed as a draggable card in a list.
- Cards support keyboard-first navigation (tab, arrow keys, Enter to edit, Delete to remove).
- Users can drag-and-drop cards to reorder them.
- The app generates a shareable URL hash containing all snippets (base64-encoded JSON), so others can restore the list by visiting the link.
- A "Share" button copies the current URL hash to the clipboard.
- The UI is clean and accessible, with clear focus states and ARIA labels.
- All code (HTML, CSS, JS) must be in one file, no external libraries.
