Dynamic CLI Data Visualizer

- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library.
- Load CSV data files interactively by specifying file path at runtime.
- Automatically parse CSV headers and numeric columns for visualization.
- Provide terminal-based interactive menu for selecting:
  - Visualization type: line plot, bar chart, histogram, or scatter plot.
  - Columns to use as X-axis and Y-axis data.
- Render basic plots as ASCII/Unicode graphics directly in terminal (e.g., scaled bar graphs, line graphs, scatter plots using characters).
- Support zooming and panning in plots via keyboard input.
- Save current plot data and configuration to a local JSON file for persistence.
- Load saved JSON configuration to restore previous session visualization.
- Include keyboard shortcuts for navigation, data reload, saving, and quitting.
- Display summary statistics (mean, median, min, max) for selected columns.
- Handle CSV parsing errors and non-numeric data gracefully with informative messages.
- Compatible with standard terminal sizes, adapt plot layout to terminal width.
- Offline first: no external dependencies, no network required.
- Designed for quick exploratory data visualization without GUI or external libraries.
