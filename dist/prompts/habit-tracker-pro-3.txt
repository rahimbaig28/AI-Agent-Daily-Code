Habit Tracker Pro

- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, datetime, os, curses for TUI).
- Terminal-based UI with curses: full-screen interface, keyboard-driven (no mouse needed).
- Displays 7-day grid of habits (responsive to terminal size: 3x7 or 5x7 grid based on width).
- Predefined habits: "Water", "Exercise", "Read", "Meditate", "Sleep 8h" (add/edit via 'a' key).
- Keyboard controls:
  * Arrow keys: navigate grid cells (today's column highlighted).
  * Space: toggle habit completion for selected day (✓/empty).
  * 'a': add new habit (prompt input, max 10 habits).
  * 'd': delete selected habit.
  * 'n': jump to next day.
  * 's': save and exit.
  * 'q': quit without save.
  * Tab: cycle habit list focus.
- Persistence: JSON file "habits.json" in script directory (auto-load on start, auto-save on 's').
- Stats panel: bottom area shows streak counts and completion % for each habit (current week).
- Offline-first: works without internet, handles missing file gracefully (start fresh).
- Color-coded: green ✓, red empty cells, yellow today, blue headers.
- Error handling: validate inputs, graceful resize on terminal change.
- Testable: Run script, add "Water", toggle 3 days, save, restart, verify persistence/stats.
