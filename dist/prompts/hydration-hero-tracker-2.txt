Hydration Hero Tracker

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS, no external dependencies.
- Offline-first: Persist daily hydration logs and streaks in localStorage; load data on startup, sync automatically.
- **Core UI**: Responsive grid layout (CSS Grid) for mobile/desktop; header with app title/logo (water drop icon via CSS), current daily intake progress bar, quick-add buttons (8oz/16oz/32oz glasses).
- **Main Features**:
  - Track water intake: Click buttons or input custom amount (oz/ml toggle); update live total with animated progress circle (0-100oz goal, customizable).
  - Daily/weekly stats grid: Show glasses logged, total oz, streak days, avg daily; 7-day history cards with fill levels.
  - Goal setter: Input field/slider for daily target (32-128oz); save to localStorage.
  - Reminders: JS timer for hourly nudges (e.g., "Drink up!" toast); configurable interval, snooze/dismiss.
  - Reset day: Button to start new day at midnight (detect via Date object).
- **Accessibility**: ARIA-compliant (role="progressbar", aria-labels on buttons/inputs, aria-live for updates); full keyboard nav (Tab/Enter/Space for actions); high-contrast mode toggle; screen-reader friendly stats (live regions).
- **Visuals**: Calming wellness theme (blues/greens gradient bg, glass icons filling with water animation); responsive: 1-col mobile, 2-col tablet, 3-col desktop.
- **Data Structure**: JSON in localStorage {entries: [{date: "YYYY-MM-DD", amount: 64}], goal: 100, streak: 5}.
- **Edge Cases**: Handle no JS (degrade to static form), clear all data button with confirm, export stats as CSV download.
- **Testable Milestones**: (1) Load/add intake, see progress update/persist. (2) Set goal, view responsive grid. (3) Keyboard-only flow works. (4) Offline add/reload intact. Under 800 LOC total.
