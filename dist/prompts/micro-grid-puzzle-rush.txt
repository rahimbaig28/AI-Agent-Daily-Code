Micro Grid Puzzle Rush
- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS (no external libraries or assets).
- **Core game**: 6x6 responsive grid of tiles (36 total), randomly shuffled at start; player clicks adjacent tiles to swap and solve to original order (numbered 1-36, blank space at bottom-right).
- **Micro game loop**: 60-second timer starts on load; auto-shuffle on solve or timeout; high-score tracking via localStorage (best time, moves count); 5 lives (lose one per invalid swap).
- **Grid features**: Touch/mouse/keyboard support (arrow keys/WASD for swaps, space/enter to shuffle); visual feedback (glow on hover, smooth swap animation <300ms, confetti burst on win).
- **Responsive design**: CSS Grid layout scales 100vw/100vh on mobile/desktop; tiles 50px min-size, gap 4px; portrait/landscape auto-adjust (4x9 grid on narrow screens).
- **UI controls**: Top bar with timer (MM:SS), moves counter, lives icons, shuffle button; bottom bar with high score, restart button; full-screen toggle (F11 hint).
- **Print-friendly**: @media print hides timer/lives, shows solved grid with numbers; black/white tiles, 1cm margins.
- **Share feature**: On win, generate short URL hash encoding moves/seed (e.g., #abc123); load parses hash to replay exact puzzle; copy-to-clipboard button.
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels on tiles ("Tile 5, row 1 col 5"), focusable grid (tabindex), high-contrast mode toggle, screen-reader announcements for timer/tile swaps.
- **Persistence**: localStorage for high scores (top 10), sound prefs (beeps on swap/win, toggleable), last played seed.
- **Performance**: <1000 LOC total; 60fps animations via requestAnimationFrame; no canvas (pure DOM).
- **Edge cases**: Prevent diagonal swaps; pause on visibilitychange; offline-first (no network).
