Mood & Hydration Tracker Pro

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS only; no external libraries or dependencies.
- ARIA-compliant: Use role="main", aria-labels on inputs/buttons, aria-live for dynamic updates, role="dialog" for modals.
- Dark/light theme toggle with localStorage persistence; default to system preference via prefers-color-scheme.
- Core tracking: Daily mood selector (emoji buttons: 😊😐😞 + custom slider 1-10) and hydration input (glasses of water, 8oz each).
- Log entries: Timestamped list showing date, mood score/color-coded, total water; add new log via form with Enter key support.
- Stats dashboard: Weekly averages (mood/hydration), streak counter (consecutive days logged), simple line chart using Canvas API (no libs).
- Undo/Redo: Ctrl+Z/Y support for last 10 actions (add/edit/delete logs); maintain action stack in memory.
- Export/Import: "Export JSON" button downloads full data as .json file; "Import JSON" opens file picker (use File API), validates/merges data.
- Persistence: All data (logs, theme, streaks) saved to localStorage; auto-save every 30s, load on init.
- Keyboard nav: Tab through form/stats, arrow keys for mood selector, Esc closes modals.
- Responsive design: Mobile-first CSS grid/flexbox; works on desktop/tablet/phone.
- Testable features: 10 sample logs on first load; clear data button; performance <60ms per log add.
- UI: Clean wellness theme (soft blues/greens), 60fps animations via requestAnimationFrame for chart updates.
