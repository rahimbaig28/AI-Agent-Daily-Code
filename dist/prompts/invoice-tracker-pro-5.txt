Invoice Tracker Pro

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS, no external dependencies.
- **Core UI**: Clean single-column layout with 12-column responsive grid (mobile-first: 320px-1200px+ breakpoints).
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Auto-detects prefers-color-scheme, toggle button, persists via localStorage; CSS custom properties for all colors.
- **Invoice List**: Displays table of invoices with columns: #, Client, Amount, Date, Status (Paid/Pending/Overdue), Actions (Edit/Delete).
- **Add/Edit Modal**: Keyboard-accessible form (Tab/Enter/Esc), fields: Client name, Amount (currency input), Due Date (date picker), Notes.
- **Keyboard-First UX**: Arrow keys navigate list, Enter opens modal/Edit, Delete key confirms deletion, Ctrl/Cmd+N new invoice, Ctrl/Cmd+S save.
- **Undo/Redo**: Ctrl/Cmd+Z/Y, tracks last 10 actions (add/edit/delete), toast notifications for undo prompts.
- **Status Logic**: Auto-mark Overdue if due date < today and unpaid; filter buttons (All/Paid/Pending/Overdue).
- **Totals**: Live summary: Total, Paid, Pending, Overdue amounts; currency formatting ($1,234.56).
- **Data Persistence**: localStorage with auto-save every 30s and on blur; load on init, graceful fallback if storage full.
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML (table, form, aria-labels), 44px touch targets, visible focus outlines, screen reader friendly (role="grid", aria-sort).
- **Performance**: Skeleton loaders on init, lazy image icons (SVG inline), no heavy animations (CSS transitions only).
- **Input Validation**: Real-time feedback (red/green borders, error messages), prevent invalid submits.
- **Empty State**: Helpful message with "Add First Invoice" CTA when list empty.
- **Export**: "Download CSV" button generates client-ready file with all data.
- Testable: Add 3 sample invoices on first load; verify undo, theme switch, filters, export.
