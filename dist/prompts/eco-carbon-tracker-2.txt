Eco Carbon Tracker

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS, no external dependencies
- Theme: Personal carbon footprint tracker for daily eco habits (transport, energy, food, waste)
- Dark green (#2d5016) and light green (#90EE90) color scheme, responsive design for mobile/desktop
- **Core features:**
  • Daily activity log: 12 predefined activities (e.g., "Car trip 5km", "Meat meal", "Flight 100km") with fixed CO2e values (kg)
  • Drag-and-drop items from activity list to daily log area (visual reorder with smooth animations)
  • Keyboard support: arrow keys to navigate activities, Enter to add to log, Delete to remove
  • Real-time **daily total CO2e** display with gauge chart (SVG circle, 0-20kg scale, color-coded red/yellow/green)
  • 7-day history view with average weekly footprint and trend arrow
- **Persistence:** localStorage saves full data (activities, log, history); auto-load on start
- **Import/Export:** 
  • Drag JSON file onto app to import data
  • "Export Data" button downloads JSON file with all history
  • "Share Summary" generates URL hash with current week stats (parse on load to restore view)
- **UI Layout:**
  • Header: App title, current day total, weekly avg badge
  • Left panel: Drag source with 12 activity cards (icon + name + CO2e kg)
  • Center: Drop zone for today's log (stacked cards, total below)
  • Right panel: 7-day history bars + share/export buttons
  • Footer: Reset day, clear all data buttons (with confirm dialog)
- **Accessibility:** ARIA labels on all interactive elements, high contrast text, focus indicators, screen reader friendly activity descriptions
- **Interactions:** 
  • Click or drag to add activity to log (dedupe same-day entries)
  • Drag log items to reorder or trash icon to remove
  • Hash navigation: #view=history or #share=encoded-data
  • Responsive: stack panels vertically on mobile (<768px)
- **Data structure:** JSON array of days [{date, activities:[{name, co2e, id}], total}]
- **Edge cases:** Offline-first, graceful localStorage quota error, mobile touch support for drag
- Total impl <800 LOC, testable: add activity, see total update, export/import, share via hash
