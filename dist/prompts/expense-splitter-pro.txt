Expense Splitter Pro

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS, no external dependencies, offline-first using localStorage.
- Dark/light theme toggle via CSS media queries and localStorage preference.
- Main dashboard shows current month summary: total income, total expenses, balance, and **50/30/20 rule breakdown** (needs/wants/savings pie chart using Canvas).
- Add income/expense form: fields for description, amount (positive for income), category (dropdown: Food, Rent, Salary, Entertainment, Utilities, Savings, Custom), date (default today), split count (1-5 people).
- **Smart splitting**: When split>1, add sub-form for each person's share (name + amount, auto-suggest equal split); totals must match original amount.
- Real-time category totals table with progress bars (green <80%, yellow 80-100%, red >100% of suggested monthly avg from localStorage).
- Suggested budgets auto-populate on first use: Food $400, Rent $1200, Utilities $200, Entertainment $300, Savings 20% of income.
- Keyboard navigation: Tab through forms, Enter to add, Arrow keys for category nav, Esc to cancel.
- Data persistence: All transactions/categories/budgets in localStorage as JSON; auto-save every 30s.
- **Export/Import**: JSON download button (all data), file upload to restore; CSV export for expenses only.
- **Print-friendly view**: Button triggers @media print CSS - hides charts/forms, shows clean table of month summary + transactions.
- Monthly selector: Dropdown for year/month, auto-generates next/prev buttons, filters data accordingly.
- Validation: Prevent negative balance warnings, duplicate descriptions, incomplete splits.
- Responsive design: Mobile-first, grid layout, touch-friendly buttons (>44px).
- Testable features: Add 3-split grocery expense, toggle themes, export/import, print preview, verify 50/30/20 pie updates on new income.
