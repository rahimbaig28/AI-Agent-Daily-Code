Invoice Organizer Pro

- Single-file Python 3 script using ONLY standard library (json, os, sys, datetime, pathlib, csv, urllib.parse, hashlib, argparse).
- Console-based app for small businesses to track unpaid invoices with due dates and amounts.
- Data persistence: Store invoices as JSON in ~/.invoice_data.json with automatic backup to ~/.invoice_data_backup.json.
- Main menu with keyboard shortcuts (1-6 keys or full commands): 
  1. List all invoices (sorted by due date, color-code overdue in red via ANSI).
  2. Add new invoice (prompt for: client name, amount (float), due_date YYYY-MM-DD, invoice_id auto-generated from hash(client+date)).
  3. Mark paid (select by number, add paid_date timestamp).
  4. Export unpaid to CSV (invoices_unpaid_YYYYMMDD.csv with columns: id,client,amount,due_date).
  5. Generate shareable summary URL hash (base64-encode JSON of unpaid totals/summary, print "python script.py --import <hash>").
  6. Import from URL hash (argparse --import HASH, decode and merge invoices).
- Auto-generate unique invoice_id using hashlib.sha256(client_name + due_date).
- Calculate and display: total unpaid, overdue total (due < today), average days overdue.
- Responsive terminal display: Use os.get_terminal_size() for width-aware tables with fixed-width columns.
- Keyboard support: Read single keys via sys.stdin.read(1), support 'q' to quit anywhere.
- Argparse CLI: script.py [--import HASH] [--export] for non-interactive use.
- Validation: Due dates must parse with datetime.strptime, amounts >0, prevent duplicate invoice_ids.
- Example workflow: Add 3 test invoices on first run, show overdue warning if any due yesterday.
- Keep total code <800 lines, robust error handling with colored output (ANSI escapes).
- Friday feature: Weekly summary showing invoices due this week (Mon-Sun).
