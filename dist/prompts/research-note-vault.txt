Research Note Vault
- Single-file HTML app with inline CSS and JS, no external dependencies.
- Offline-first research note organizer using localStorage for persistence.
- Core UI: Sticky top nav bar with tabs (Notes, Tags, Export), main card-based note list with search bar, and right sidebar for editing selected note.
- Note cards display title, preview (first 100 chars), tags, date created/modified, and checkbox for pinning; cards use card pattern for scannability.
- Add note: Click "+" button or sidebar form with title input, rich text area (bold/italic via simple buttons), tag input (comma-separated), supports drag-and-drop file upload for images/PDFs (display thumbnails/previews).
- Search: Real-time fuzzy search across title/content/tags; filter by tag dropdown.
- Tags: Auto-complete from existing tags; sidebar shows tag cloud with counts and delete.
- Edit/delete notes: Select card to load into sidebar; keyboard shortcuts (Enter to save, Esc to cancel, Delete to remove).
- Undo/redo: Ctrl+Z/Y stack for note additions/edits/deletes (store up to 50 actions in memory).
- Sort notes: Dropdown for newest first, title A-Z, pinned top.
- Export/import: JSON download button (all notes with metadata/files as base64); import parses JSON and merges/replaces.
- Accessibility: ARIA labels on all interactive elements, keyboard nav (Tab/arrow keys for lists, Enter to select), high-contrast mode toggle, screen-reader friendly card announcements.
- Responsive: Mobile-first, cards stack vertically on small screens, sidebar collapses to modal.
- Loading states: Skeleton loaders for notes during search/filter; fallback empty state with "Add your first research note" prompt.
- File handling: Drag-drop zone in sidebar with progress bar, file size limit 5MB, preview images inline in note content.
- Persistence: Auto-save every 30s to localStorage; load on startup with version check (migrate if schema changes).
- Testable features: Add 5 sample notes on first load; verify undo/redo restores; export JSON validates; search finds partial tags.
