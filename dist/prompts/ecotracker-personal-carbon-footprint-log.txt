EcoTracker: Personal Carbon Footprint Log

- Build a single-file web app that helps users track daily activities impacting their carbon footprint.
- Display a simple dashboard showing total estimated CO2 emissions for the current month.
- Allow users to add, edit, and remove tracked activities (e.g., "drive car 10km", "eat vegetarian meal", "recycle 1kg").
- Each activity must have a name, category (transport, food, waste, energy), and estimated CO2 impact (kg).
- Support offline-first: persist all data in localStorage; app works without internet.
- Keyboard-first UX: all actions (add, edit, delete, navigate) must be possible via keyboard.
- Implement drag-and-drop reordering of activities in the list.
- Show a summary card with monthly total and a breakdown by category.
- Include a reset button to clear all data (with confirmation).
- Use plain HTML, CSS, and JS; no external libraries.
- Ensure all UI elements are accessible (ARIA labels, focus management).
