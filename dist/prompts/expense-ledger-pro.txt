Expense Ledger Pro

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS, no external dependencies, fully offline-first using localStorage for persistence.
- ARIA-compliant: all interactive elements have role, aria-label, aria-live for screen readers; keyboard-navigable (Tab, Enter, Escape, Arrow keys).
- Auto theme detection: use prefers-color-scheme for dark/light mode, with manual toggle button (persists in localStorage); smooth CSS transitions.
- Core UI: centered card layout (max 600px wide, responsive mobile-first); header with app title, theme toggle, reset data button (confirm dialog).
- Main sections:
  * Balance summary: three large cards showing **Total Income** (green), **Total Expenses** (red), **Net Balance** (green/red based on value); updates live with aria-live="polite".
  * Transaction form: inputs for Description (text, required), Amount (number, positive only), Category (select: Income, Food, Transport, Entertainment, Utilities, Other); Add button.
  * Transactions list: sortable table (click headers for date/desc/amount/category), each row has delete button (X icon); empty state message.
- Features:
  * Add transaction: validate inputs, store as {id: timestamp, desc, amt: number, cat, date: ISO}, update summaries, sort list newest-first.
  * Delete transaction: confirm dialog, remove from localStorage, recalculate summaries.
  * Summaries: Income = sum(category=='Income'), Expenses = sum(others), Balance = Income - Expenses; format as currency ($X,XXX.XX), colorize balance <0 red.
  * Sorting: click table headers to toggle asc/desc by date/desc/amount; persist sort state in localStorage.
  * Filter: dropdown above table (All, Income, Expenses, by Category); live filter without page reload.
  * Data persistence: on load, retrieve/parse localStorage 'ledger' array or start empty; auto-save after every add/delete.
  * Reset: clear localStorage, reset UI to zeroed state (confirm prompt).
- Keyboard support: form submits on Enter, focus management (trap in modal dialogs), table navigation with Arrow keys + Enter to delete.
- Styling: modern neumorphic design (soft shadows, rounded corners); responsive grid (mobile stacks cards vertically); animations for add/delete (fade/slide).
- Edge cases: handle negative balance styling, invalid inputs (prevent add, shake animation), empty list shows "No transactions - add one above!".
- Testing: loads with sample data option (checkbox on first load), console-free (no logs), PWA-like manifest in <head> for offline install hint.
