Daily Health Logger

• Single-file Python 3 script (standard library only) that logs daily health metrics and displays weekly summaries.

• Core Features:
  - Log daily entries: water intake (cups), sleep hours, exercise minutes, mood (1-5 scale), and optional notes.
  - Store all data in a JSON file (health_log.json) in the user's home directory for persistence across sessions.
  - Display today's entry status and quick stats (total water, avg sleep, total exercise for the week).
  - Show a 7-day summary table with all metrics and weekly averages.
  - Delete or edit the most recent entry if needed.

• User Interaction:
  - Command-line menu loop with numbered options (1. Log today, 2. View week, 3. Edit last, 4. Delete last, 5. Exit).
  - Input validation: water/sleep/exercise as positive numbers, mood as 1-5.
  - Keyboard-first: arrow keys optional; numeric selection primary.
  - Graceful error handling for invalid input or missing data file.

• Data & Persistence:
  - JSON file stores array of daily records: {date, water, sleep, exercise, mood, notes}.
  - Auto-create health_log.json on first run.
  - Load and parse existing data on startup; append new entries.

• Output & Accessibility:
  - Clear, readable console output with aligned columns for weekly view.
  - Print-friendly summary: generate a plain-text report of the week (optional menu item).
  - No external dependencies; runs on Python 3.6+.
  - Simple, high-contrast text for terminal readability.

• Edge Cases:
  - Handle missing or corrupt JSON gracefully (warn user, start fresh).
  - Prevent duplicate entries for the same date; offer update option if logging twice.
  - Support timezone-agnostic date tracking (YYYY-MM-DD format).
