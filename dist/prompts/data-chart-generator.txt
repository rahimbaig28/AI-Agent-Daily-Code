Data Chart Generator

• Single-file Python 3 script using only the standard library (no external libraries like matplotlib, pandas, or plotly).
• Generate ASCII-based charts and data visualizations from user input or built-in sample datasets.
• Support chart types: line charts, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots (all rendered as ASCII art in the terminal).
• Allow users to input custom data via comma-separated values or select from 3 pre-loaded sample datasets (sales trends, temperature readings, survey results).
• Display chart with configurable dimensions (width/height) and optional grid overlay.
• Auto-detect terminal width and height; adapt chart size responsively to fit the screen.
• Implement dark/light mode toggle (via ANSI color codes) that auto-detects system preference via environment variables or user choice.
• Persist user preferences and recently used datasets to a local JSON file in the script's directory (no external dependencies).
• Include a "share" feature: generate a shareable string (base64-encoded chart config) that users can paste to recreate the same visualization.
• Keyboard navigation: arrow keys to scroll through datasets, number keys to select chart type, 'd' for dark/light toggle, 's' to save/share config, 'q' to quit.
• Display legend, axis labels, and summary statistics (min, max, average) below each chart.
• Support up to 50 data points per dataset; gracefully truncate or sample larger datasets.
• Include a help menu (press 'h') showing all commands and keyboard shortcuts.
