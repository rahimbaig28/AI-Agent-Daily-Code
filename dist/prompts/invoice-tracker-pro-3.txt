Invoice Tracker Pro

- Single-file Python 3 script using ONLY standard library (pathlib, json, csv, argparse, curses, collections).
- Console-based TUI using curses for keyboard-first UX: arrow keys navigate, Enter edits/selects, 'i' inserts row, 'd' deletes row, 'u' undo, 'r' redo, 's' save/export, 'q' quit.
- Data model: List of invoices with fields (ID auto-increment, Date YYYY-MM-DD, Customer, Amount float, Status: pending/paid/overdue).
- Persistence: Load/save invoices to invoices.json in script directory; export to invoices.csv.
- Undo/redo stack: 20 levels deep using two deques (actions/undone_actions); each action stores full list state as JSON.
- Responsive grid view: curses table shows 5 columns (truncate long text), 20 rows max (scroll with PgUp/PgDn or arrows); highlight selected row.
- Keyboard shortcuts displayed at bottom: [↑↓] Navigate [Enter] Edit [Tab] Next field [i] Insert [d] Delete [u] Undo [r] Redo [s] Save/Export [q] Quit.
- Edit mode: Inline single-field editor (date/customer/amount/status dropdown); validate date (strptime), amount (>0).
- Status colors: pending=yellow, paid=green, overdue=red (if date < today).
- Stats footer: Total invoices, total amount, pending count.
- Command-line args: python invoice_tracker.py [--file custom.json] [--export output.csv].
- Auto-save every 10 changes; confirm overwrites.
- Testable: Run empty -> add 3 invoices -> undo/redo -> export CSV -> verify file contents match.
