Daily Habit Forge
- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, datetime, os, sys, readline for input completion).
- Console-based app for tracking daily habits with productivity streaks.
- Data persistence: Load/save habits to 'habits.json' with task name, streak count, last completed date.
- Main loop displays menu: 1=List habits, 2=Add habit, 3=Complete habit (today), 4=Reset streak, 5=View streaks report, 6=Search by name, 0=Quit.
- List habits: Show sorted by streak descending, format: "[X] Habit Name (streak: 5 days, last: 2026-01-20)".
- Add habit: Prompt for name (unique, max 50 chars), init streak=0.
- Complete habit: Select by number, update streak if last date != today, set last_completed to today; print "Streak now X!".
- Reset streak: Select habit, set streak=0.
- Streaks report: Print top 3 longest streaks, total habits, avg streak.
- Search: Filter habits by substring (case-insensitive), use readline for tab-completion on habit names.
- Undo/redo: Track last 5 actions in stack (add/complete/reset), commands 7=Undo, 8=Redo; save stacks to JSON.
- Print-friendly: Command 9=Export report to 'habit_report.txt' (tabular format: name, streak, last date).
- Keyboard: Full arrow/tab support via readline, clear screen on menu refresh (os.system('clear' or 'cls')).
- Edge cases: Validate dates, prevent dup names, handle missing JSON (create empty), auto-backup on exit.
- Testable: Run script, add "Meditate", complete 3 days, undo last, export, verify JSON integrity.
