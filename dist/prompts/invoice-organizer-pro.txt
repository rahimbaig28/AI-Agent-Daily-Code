Invoice Organizer Pro

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS, no external dependencies, offline-first using localStorage.
- Responsive card-based grid layout (1-4 columns based on screen size) for displaying invoices, fully mobile-friendly with CSS Grid and media queries.
- Core functionality: Add new invoice via modal form with fields for Invoice #, Client Name, Amount (currency input), Due Date (date picker), Status (dropdown: Pending/Paid/Overdue), and Notes.
- Drag-and-drop file upload area for attaching receipt/image (display thumbnail preview, store as base64 in localStorage, limit to 5MB per file).
- Auto-compute **total due**, **pending total**, and **overdue count** from stored invoices, shown in sticky header dashboard cards.
- Sort and filter grid by Status, Due Date, or Client (with clear button); search by Invoice # or Client name.
- Inline edit: Click any card to edit fields directly, with save/cancel buttons; mark as Paid to auto-update status based on due date.
- Persistence: All data (invoices array with attached files as base64) saved to localStorage on every change; load on init with empty state ("No invoices yet - add one to start!").
- Keyboard support: Tab navigation through all inputs/buttons, Enter to save forms, Escape to close modals, Arrow keys to navigate grid cards.
- Print-friendly view: Button triggers print stylesheet (@media print) hiding UI elements, showing clean table of all invoices with totals, optimized for A4 paper.
- Visual states: Color-coded cards (green=Paid, orange=Pending, red=Overdue), progress bar for file upload simulation, empty state with upload prompt.
- Export: "Export CSV" button downloads current filtered/sorted invoices as CSV file for accounting backup.
- Theme: Clean professional blue/gray palette for small business use, with subtle animations (CSS transitions) for card hover/add/remove.
