TaskGrid: Small Business Daily Planner

- Build a single-file web app (one HTML file with inline CSS/JS) for small business owners to plan and track daily tasks.
- Display a responsive grid of up to 12 task slots, each with a title input, time estimate dropdown (15min, 30min, 1h, 2h), and a checkbox for completion.
- Allow drag-and-drop reordering of task slots within the grid.
- Persist task data in localStorage so progress survives page reloads.
- Add a "Share" button that generates a URL with the current tasks encoded in the hash (URL fragment), enabling easy sharing via link.
- Support keyboard navigation: arrow keys move focus between task inputs, Enter toggles completion, and Tab moves through controls.
- Include a "Reset Day" button to clear all tasks and start fresh.
- Ensure the UI is mobile-friendly and accessible (ARIA labels, focus management).
