Accessibility Text Analyzer

• Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, re, statistics, pathlib)
• Analyze text files for readability metrics: average word length, sentence length, Flesch-Kincaid grade level, passive voice percentage
• Import plain-text or JSON files; export analysis results as JSON
• Persistent storage: save analysis history to a local JSON database (results.json in script directory)
• Command-line interface with menu: (1) Analyze file, (2) View history, (3) Export to JSON, (4) Clear history, (5) Exit
• Readability scoring: flag text >18 grade level or >20 words/sentence as "hard to read"; highlight accessibility issues
• Statistics module for computing mean/median word and sentence lengths across corpus
• Input validation: handle missing files, empty text, encoding errors gracefully
• Output: print formatted results to console; optionally save raw metrics as JSON with timestamp
• No external dependencies; all calculations use regex and built-in string methods
