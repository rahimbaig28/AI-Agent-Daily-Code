Daily Habit Tracker
- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, os, datetime, curses for TUI).
- Console-based terminal UI with curses: full-screen interface, keyboard-navigable.
- Track daily habits: add/edit/delete habits (e.g., "Exercise 30min", "Read 20 pages") with yes/no completion checkboxes.
- Auto-load/save data to 'habits.json' in script directory; create if missing; timestamp entries with UTC dates.
- Main screen: table of habits (name, streak count, today's status, last completed date); highlight current day.
- Keyboard controls: arrow keys to navigate/select habit, SPACE to toggle completion, 'a' add new habit, 'e' edit selected, 'd' delete selected, 'r' reset streak, 'q' quit and save, '?' help overlay.
- Features: calculate streaks (consecutive completed days), show completion % for week/month, motivational summary (e.g., "5-day streak on Exercise!").
- Persistence: JSON structure [{"name": str, "streak": int, "completions": {YYYY-MM-DD: bool}}]; load on start, auto-save on quit/action.
- Offline-first: fully local, no network; handle missing file gracefully.
- Undo/redo: 10-step history stack (push state on add/edit/delete/toggle; 'u' undo, 'y' redo).
- Accessibility: screen reader friendly via clear labels/status messages; high-contrast colors; keyboard-only navigation with focus indicators.
- Testable: run script, add "Test Habit", toggle completion 3 days (simulate dates via manual edit), verify streak=3 and JSON saved; test undo after delete.
- Keep under 800 LOC: simple curses grid (20x80), no external deps, compact JSON handling.
