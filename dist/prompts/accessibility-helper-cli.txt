Accessibility Helper CLI

- Build a single-file Python 3 script (standard library only) that acts as an accessibility helper for terminal users.
- The app must provide keyboard-first navigation: use arrow keys and Enter to move between and select options.
- Features:
  - List common accessibility actions: toggle dark/light theme, print-friendly view, keyboard shortcuts cheat sheet, and system info.
  - Dark/light theme: detect system preference (via environment or heuristic) and allow manual override; output ANSI color codes for terminal theming.
  - Print-friendly view: output plain text without color or formatting, suitable for printing or screen readers.
  - Keyboard shortcuts: display a list of accessible shortcuts for the app itself.
  - System info: show basic system details (OS, Python version, terminal size).
- Persist user preferences (theme, last viewed section) in a local JSON config file.
- Ensure all output is accessible: use clear labels, avoid ambiguous symbols, and support screen reader navigation.
- Include a help screen with instructions for keyboard navigation and accessibility features.
- All interactions must be possible via keyboard only; no mouse required.
- The app should run in any standard terminal and be compatible with screen readers.
