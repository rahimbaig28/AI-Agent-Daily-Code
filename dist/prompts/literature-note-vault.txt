Literature Note Vault
- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, os, datetime, pathlib, sys, webbrowser, platform).
- Offline-first research note manager: create, read, update, delete notes with title, content, tags, timestamp.
- Data persistence: store all notes in 'litnotes.json' file in script directory; auto-save on every change; load on startup.
- Core UI: console-based with numbered menu (1=New note, 2=List notes, 3=Edit note, 4=Delete note, 5=Search tags, 6=Export HTML, 7=Quit).
- New note: prompt for title/content/tags; auto-assign unique ID and timestamp; save immediately.
- List notes: display all notes sorted by modified date (newest first) with ID, title, tags, last modified; keyboard-navigable via numbers.
- Edit note: select by number, edit title/content/tags; update timestamp on save.
- Delete note: select by number, confirm before permanent delete from JSON.
- Search tags: filter notes by comma-separated tags; show matching subset.
- Export HTML: generate print-friendly 'notes_export.html' with all notes styled for printing (CSS in <style>); auto-open in default browser.
- Accessibility/keyboard: all actions via numbered input or single keys (n=new, l=list, e=edit, d=delete, s=search, x=export, q=quit); clear prompts.
- Error handling: validate inputs, handle corrupt/missing JSON (backup to 'litnotes_backup.json', recreate empty).
- Share feature: export includes URL-hash-friendly note IDs; notes list shows shareable ID strings.
- Testable features: verify new note saves/loads; edit updates timestamp; search finds tags; export opens valid HTML; persistence survives restarts.
