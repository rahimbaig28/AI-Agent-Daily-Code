Micro Grid Puzzle

- Single-file Python 3 script using only standard library (json, random, os, sys, curses).
- Terminal-based **micro puzzle game** where players solve 5x5 grids by toggling cells to match target patterns.
- On launch: Generate random 5x5 target grid (0=empty, 1=filled), save to 'puzzle.json'; display current player grid below target using curses.
- Controls: Arrow keys/WASD to navigate cursor, SPACE/Enter to toggle cell (0<->1), R to regenerate puzzle, S to save progress to 'puzzle.json', Q/ESC to quit.
- Win condition: Player grid matches target exactly; show "Solved!" in bold green, offer new puzzle.
- Persistence: Load 'puzzle.json' on start if exists (target + player grid); auto-save every 5 moves.
- Features: 
  - Move counter and win moves display.
  - Visual feedback: Target rows green/white, player rows blue/white, cursor highlight yellow, invalid moves beep.
  - Keyboard-only: Full ARIA-like announcements via status line (e.g., "Toggled cell (2,3), moves: 12").
  - Share: Generate hash string of target (base64-encoded grid), print "Share: python gridgame.py --load <hash>".
- CLI args: "python gridgame.py --load <hash>" to load from shared hash.
- Responsive grid: Auto-scale chars for 80x24+ terminals; center 5x5 view.
- Testable: Solve sample puzzle in <20 moves; verify load/save with json dump; quit cleanly.
