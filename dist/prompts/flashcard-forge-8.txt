Flashcard Forge

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS, no external dependencies.
- **Core feature**: Create, edit, delete flashcards with front/back content (text only).
- **Study mode**: Flip cards with Spacebar/click, track correct/incorrect (1-5 rating), show progress stats.
- **Deck management**: Add new decks, switch between decks, persist all data in localStorage (decks as JSON array).
- **Theme system**: Auto-detects prefers-color-scheme (dark/light), manual toggle button, persists preference.
- **Responsive grid**: Cards in 2-4 column masonry grid (adapts to screen width >=320px), scales text for mobile.
- **Keyboard support**: Arrow keys navigate cards, Enter flips, +/- rate answer, Esc closes modals.
- **Print-friendly**: @media print hides nav/controls, shows all cards front/back in 1-column layout with borders.
- **UI structure**:
  - Header: App title, theme toggle, deck selector dropdown.
  - Main grid: Card list with flip preview.
  - Add card modal: Front/back inputs, deck assign, Save/Cancel buttons.
  - Study button per deck: Enters full-screen study mode with stats overlay.
  - Footer: Total cards count, clear all data warning button.
- **Interactions**:
  - Click card edge to edit, drag to reorder within deck.
  - Study mode: Big flip animation, rating stars (1-5), next/prev buttons.
  - Empty state: Welcome screen with "Create your first deck" CTA.
- **Visual design**: Clean sans-serif (system fonts), subtle shadows, smooth transitions (0.2s ease), max-width 1200px centered.
- **Data format**: JSON in localStorage {decks: [{name, cards:[{front, back, rating:0, id}]}]}, auto-save on changes.
- **Edge cases**: Handle no JS (static welcome), large decks (virtualize if >50 cards), mobile swipe for flip/nav.
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels on cards/buttons, focus management, high-contrast text, screen-reader friendly stats.
