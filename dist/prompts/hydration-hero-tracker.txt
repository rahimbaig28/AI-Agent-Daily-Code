Hydration Hero Tracker

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS only; no external libraries or dependencies.
- App tracks daily water intake with visual progress ring (0-100oz goal, customizable), logging glasses (8oz each) via large tap/click buttons.
- **Auto dark/light theme**: Detects prefers-color-scheme on load, toggles with sun/moon button; persists in localStorage.
- **Keyboard-first UX**: Tab-focusable buttons (Enter/Space to log/drink), Arrow keys navigate log history, 'D' deletes last entry, ESC closes modals.
- Real-time stats: Current intake, glasses logged, time-based reminders (every 2hrs via setInterval), streak counter (daily resets at midnight UTC).
- Log history: Scrollable list of timestamps/volumes for the day; **undo/redo** stack (Ctrl+Z/Y or buttons) for last 10 actions, persists across sessions.
- Input modal: Edit goal (oz), glass size (oz), accessed via gear icon or 'G' key; validates numbers only.
- Motivational tips: Random wellness quotes rotate on load/new day, health facts on milestone achievements (e.g., 64oz: "Great job!").
- Persistence: All data (logs, settings, streaks) in localStorage as JSON; auto-save every 30s, load on init.
- Responsive design: Mobile-first, full-height layout, large touch targets (48px min), high-contrast colors for accessibility (WCAG AA).
- Testable features:
  - Log 8 glasses → ring fills to 64oz, shows streak +1.
  - Toggle theme → UI updates instantly, persists.
  - Ctrl+Z after logging → undoes last glass.
  - Resize window → reflows perfectly on phone/desktop.
  - Clear localStorage → resets to defaults, no crashes.
- CSS: Use CSS Grid/Flexbox, custom properties for themes, smooth animations (<span>ring SVG stroke, 0.3s ease), focus-visible outlines.
- JS: Event listeners for keyboard/mouse, Date APIs for daily reset, simple undo stack as array of {action: 'add/remove', volume: 8, time: Date}.
- Keep total code <800 lines: Minimalist UI (header, main ring+buttons, stats panel, history footer).
