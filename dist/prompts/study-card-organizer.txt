Study Card Organizer

- Single-file responsive web app (one HTML file with inline CSS/JS, no external libraries).
- Allows users to create, edit, and organize study cards with a front (question) and back (answer) text field.
- Displays cards in a responsive grid layout that adapts to screen size (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Users can drag-and-drop cards to reorder them visually; order persists across sessions using localStorage.
- Supports a simple undo/redo stack for card edits, additions, deletions, and reorder actions.
- Clicking a card toggles flipping it to show front or back content with a smooth CSS animation.
- Provides a minimal toolbar with buttons: Add Card, Undo, Redo, and Clear All (with confirmation).
- Keyboard accessible: tab navigation through buttons and cards, Enter or Space to flip cards, keyboard shortcuts for undo (Ctrl+Z) and redo (Ctrl+Y).
- Cards autosave on change and reorder to localStorage for persistence between sessions.
- Clean, minimal design with clear typography and ample white space for focus and readability.
- Uses semantic HTML elements and ARIA attributes for accessibility support.
