Vocabulary Flashcard Study System

• Single-file Python 3 CLI app using only standard library (json, sqlite3, random, datetime, argparse)
• Create and manage flashcard decks stored as JSON files in a local study directory
• Each deck contains cards with "question" and "answer" fields, plus metadata (created date, last reviewed, review count)
• Core commands: add-deck, add-card, study (interactive quiz mode), list-decks, export-deck, import-deck, delete-deck, stats
• Study mode: display question, user types answer, reveal correct answer, user rates confidence (1-5), track performance metrics
• Persistence: auto-save deck progress (review dates, confidence scores) to JSON after each session
• Export/import: save entire deck as portable JSON file; import external JSON decks with format validation
• Statistics: show per-deck metrics (total cards, cards mastered, average confidence, review streak, time spent)
• Spaced repetition algorithm: prioritize cards not reviewed recently or with low confidence scores (simple, no heavy library)
• Keyboard shortcuts in study mode: [Enter] to reveal, [1-5] to rate, [n] for next card, [q] to quit, [s] to skip
• Print-friendly output: --print-deck flag exports deck as formatted text (question/answer pairs) suitable for terminal or PDF redirection
• Dark/light mode toggle: --theme flag (auto-detect terminal capability, store preference in config JSON)
• Validate JSON deck files on load; graceful error messages for corrupt or missing files
• Keep total code under 900 lines; focus on core study workflow over advanced features
