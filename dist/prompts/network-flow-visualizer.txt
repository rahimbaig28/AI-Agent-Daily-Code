Network Flow Visualizer

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS (no external libraries or dependencies).
- Offline-first: Load sample network data (50 nodes, 100 edges) from inline JSON; persist custom data, layouts, and history in localStorage.
- Canvas-based **force-directed graph** visualization of nodes (circles) and edges (lines) with physics simulation using Verlet integration.
- **Core interactions**:
  * Drag nodes to reposition (updates simulation).
  * Click node: Highlight connected nodes/edges, show tooltip with node ID, degree, and clustered label.
  * Mouse wheel: Zoom in/out (0.1x to 5x scale).
  * Keyboard: Arrow keys pan view; Space toggles simulation pause; Delete removes selected node/edges.
- **Controls panel** (top-right, ARIA-compliant):
  * Buttons: Play/Pause sim (aria-label), Reset layout, Add random node (5/node limit), Clear graph.
  * Sliders: Link distance (50-300px), Charge strength (-500 to 0), Node size (4-12px) – all update live with aria-valuetext.
  * Dropdown: Layout presets (Force, Circle, Grid) with aria-expanded.
  * Export/Import JSON button for sharing graphs.
- **Undo/Redo** (Ctrl+Z/Y): 20-step history stack stored in localStorage; ARIA live region announces actions ("Node added", "Layout reset").
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard nav (Tab-focusable controls, canvas fallback SVG export), high-contrast mode toggle (CSS prefers-contrast), screen reader support via aria-live for updates and alt text on export.
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-friendly (touch-drag/zoom), scales to 100% viewport width/height.
- **Performance**: Limit to 100 nodes/300 edges; 60fps sim with requestAnimationFrame.
- **Visual style**: Dark theme (#1a1a1a bg, #4a90e2 nodes, #7f8c8d edges), smooth transitions (0.3s ease), glow on hover.
- Testable features: Load graph → drag 3 nodes → change sliders → undo → export JSON → reload verifies persistence.
