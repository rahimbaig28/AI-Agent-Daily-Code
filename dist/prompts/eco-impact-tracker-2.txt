Eco Impact Tracker
- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS only, no external libraries or dependencies.
- **Core purpose**: Track personal daily eco-actions (e.g., recycling, water saved, km biked) and calculate carbon footprint reduction with sustainability tips.
- **Responsive grid layout**: 12-column CSS Grid for desktop/tablet/mobile; cards stack vertically on small screens (<768px), auto-fit columns on larger.
- **Offline-first persistence**: Use localStorage to save user data (daily logs, totals, goals); auto-load on startup, sync changes instantly.
- **Dark/light auto theme**: Detect prefers-color-scheme media query on load, toggle with button; persist preference in localStorage; smooth CSS transitions.
- **Main sections** (full-height app, no page reloads):
  * Header: App title, theme toggle button (sun/moon icons via CSS), reset data button (confirm dialog).
  * Dashboard grid: 3 cards showing weekly total CO2 saved (kg), streak days, progress to monthly goal (circular SVG progress ring).
  * Action logger: Form with dropdown (Bike 5km, Recycle 2kg, etc., 10 predefined actions with fixed CO2 savings values), date picker (default today), quantity input; Add button saves to localStorage array.
  * History grid: Scrollable cards of past entries (date, action, savings); filter by week/month buttons; delete individual entries.
  * Tips panel: Expandable accordion with 5 sustainability tips (e.g., "Switch to LED: saves 75% energy"); randomized daily tip highlight.
- **Data model** (JSON in localStorage under 'ecoData'):
  * Array of logs: [{id: unique timestamp, date: YYYY-MM-DD, action: string, qty: number, co2Saved: number}].
  * Settings: {goalMonthly: 50, theme: 'auto/dark/light', streak: number}.
  * Compute totals dynamically: sum CO2, streak (consecutive days with actions), goal progress.
- **Interactions** (keyboard-accessible, ARIA labels everywhere):
  * Tab through all inputs/buttons; Enter to submit form; Arrow keys for dropdowns.
  * Form validation: Prevent invalid qty (<0.1), show error messages.
  * Real-time updates: Dashboard refreshes on add/delete; animations (CSS scale/fade) for new entries.
  * Default goal 50kg/month CO2 saved; editable in settings modal (gear icon).
- **Visuals and UX**:
  * Clean eco-theme: Greens (#4CAF50), earth tones; dark mode inverts to dark greens/grays.
  * Icons via CSS (no images): Simple SVG paths for bike/trash/recycle in buttons.
  * Mobile-first: Touch-friendly buttons (>44px), swipe to delete history items.
  * PWA basics: Add <meta name="viewport">, <link rel="manifest"> (inline JSON for offline install).
- **Edge cases**: Handle empty data (welcome screen with sample action), localStorage quota error (fallback to session), offline warning toast.
- **Testable features**: Load app, add 3 actions, verify totals update, toggle theme, go offline/reload (data persists), resize window (layout adapts), reset clears all.
