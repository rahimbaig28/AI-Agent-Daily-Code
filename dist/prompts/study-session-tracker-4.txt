Study Session Tracker

• Single-file Python 3 script (standard library only; no external dependencies)
• Track study sessions with subject, duration (minutes), date, and notes
• Store all data in a JSON file (study_sessions.json) in the script's directory for persistence across runs
• Command-line interface with menu: (1) Log new session, (2) View all sessions, (3) Filter by subject, (4) Generate study summary, (5) Export to CSV, (6) Import from JSON, (7) Exit
• Log new session: prompt user for subject name, duration in minutes, optional notes; auto-timestamp each entry
• View all sessions: display all logged sessions in a formatted table (subject, date, duration, notes)
• Filter by subject: list all sessions for a specific subject with total hours studied for that subject
• Study summary: display statistics including total sessions, total study hours, average session length, most-studied subject, and study streak (consecutive days with at least one session)
• Export to CSV: write all sessions to study_sessions.csv with headers (Subject, Date, Duration_Minutes, Notes)
• Import from JSON: load sessions from an external JSON file and merge with existing data (skip duplicates by date+subject+duration)
• Data validation: reject negative durations, require non-empty subject names, handle file I/O errors gracefully
• On startup: load existing study_sessions.json if present; create empty file if missing
• Keyboard support: all menu selections via number input; simple text prompts for data entry
• No external libraries; use json, csv, datetime, and collections from standard library
