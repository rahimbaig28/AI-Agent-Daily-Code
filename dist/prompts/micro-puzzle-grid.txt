Micro Puzzle Grid
- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS, no external dependencies.
- Responsive 4x4 grid of tappable puzzle tiles; goal: rearrange numbered tiles 1-15 plus one empty space to sorted order (15-puzzle classic).
- Auto-generate solvable random shuffle on load or "New Game" button; validate win condition (tiles 1-15 left-to-right, top-to-bottom).
- **Core controls**: Click/tap adjacent tiles to slide into empty space; full keyboard support (arrow keys, WASD, Vim HJKL).
- Undo/redo stack (max 50 moves): Ctrl+Z (undo), Ctrl+Y (redo), buttons for mobile; persist full game state/history in localStorage.
- **Dark/light theme**: Auto-detect prefers-color-scheme, toggle button; smooth CSS transitions for tile moves and theme swap.
- Move counter, best score persistence (localStorage, per theme); win modal with confetti animation (CSS keyframes only).
- Sticky top bar: theme toggle, undo/redo buttons, new game, move count, best score.
- Mobile-first responsive: grid scales 100vw max 600px, touch-friendly 80px tiles; landscape rotates to 6x3 variant.
- Empty state: Illustrated "No moves yet" with tip on first load.
- Accessibility: ARIA labels on tiles/grid, live move count region, high-contrast mode support, skip-to-content link.
- Performance: 60fps animations via requestAnimationFrame; under 800 LOC total.
- Test features: Load→shuffle→solve→verify win/undo/redo/theme/best score persists→resize/keyboard only.
