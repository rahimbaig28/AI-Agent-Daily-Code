Invoice Tracker

- Build a single-file Python 3 script using only the standard library.
- The app allows small business owners to create, view, and manage simple invoice records.
- Each invoice has: ID (auto-generated), client name, date (auto-filled as today if not provided), amount, and status (draft, sent, paid).
- Store all invoices in a local JSON file for persistence.
- Support adding new invoices via a command-line menu.
- List all invoices with filtering by status.
- Allow editing an invoice's status (e.g., mark as paid).
- Support deleting an invoice by ID.
- Include a command to export all invoices as a CSV file (using csv module).
- Ensure all user input is validated (e.g., non-empty client name, valid amount).
- Provide a simple, clear menu-driven interface (no GUI).
- Include basic error handling for file operations and invalid input.
- Add a help command to show available actions.
- Make the script runnable directly (use if __name__ == "__main__":).
- Do not use external dependencies; only standard library modules.
