Accessible Color Contrast Checker

• Single-file Python 3 script using only the standard library (no external dependencies)
• Command-line tool that analyzes text/background color pairs and reports WCAG 2.1 contrast ratios
• Accept hex color inputs (e.g., #FFFFFF, #000000) via interactive prompts or command-line arguments
• Calculate relative luminance for each color using the official WCAG formula
• Compute contrast ratio and determine pass/fail status for AA (4.5:1 normal text) and AAA (7:1 normal text) standards
• Display results with clear pass/fail indicators and specific WCAG compliance level
• Include undo/redo stack for the last 10 color pair checks, with commands to navigate history
• Support drag-and-drop simulation via keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys to cycle through saved pairs)
• Persist all checked color pairs and results to a local JSON file (in user's home directory) for session recovery
• Provide keyboard-only navigation: Tab to move between inputs, Enter to submit, U for undo, R for redo, Q to quit
• Output formatted as plain text tables showing color hex, luminance values, contrast ratio, and compliance badges
• Validate hex color format and provide helpful error messages for invalid input
• Include a quick reference guide (printed on startup or via --help) explaining WCAG standards and contrast importance for accessibility
