DataViz CLI Explorer

- A single-file Python 3 script CLI application for exploratory data visualization on CSV files.
- Loads user-specified CSV data from disk and parses headers for column selection.
- Allows user to interactively select chart types from: line plot, bar chart, scatter plot, histogram, and pie chart.
- Enables user to choose columns for X and Y axes or category/value roles depending on chart type.
- Renders charts using matplotlib inline with clear axis labels, titles, and legends.
- Supports keyboard-driven menus and prompts for accessible navigation.
- Saves generated charts as PNG files with user-defined filenames.
- Provides a print-friendly summary report of the data file (row count, column stats) and last generated chart filename.
- Maintains simple session persistence by storing last used CSV filepath and chart preferences in a local JSON config file.
- Includes error handling for invalid inputs, missing columns, or empty data.
- No external dependencies beyond Python standard library and matplotlib (commonly preinstalled).
- Runs entirely in terminal/console, no GUI; suitable for quick data visualization without complex setup.
