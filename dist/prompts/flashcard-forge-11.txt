Flashcard Forge

- Single-file HTML app with inline CSS and JS (no external dependencies).
- **Core feature**: Create, edit, delete flashcards with front (question) and back (answer) fields.
- **Study mode**: Flip cards with spacebar/click; track correct/incorrect via Enter/N; show progress stats.
- **Grid layout**: Responsive 3-column grid on desktop, 1-column mobile; CSS Grid + media queries.
- **Persistence**: Save decks to localStorage as JSON; auto-load on start, 5-min idle autosave.
- **Multiple decks**: Tabs for "New Deck", deck list, study view; name decks and reorder via drag.
- **Offline-first**: Full functionality without network; PWA-capable (add to home screen).
- **Share via URL hash**: Encode current deck state in #hash (deck name + cards); parse on load.
- **Keyboard support**: Tab-focusable inputs/buttons; Enter to add/flip/answer; Esc to cancel/edit.
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels on cards/buttons; high-contrast mode toggle; screen-reader friendly flips.
- **Visual design**: Clean sans-serif font; card hover shadows; green/red for correct/incorrect; progress bar.
- **Stats panel**: Show deck size, mastery % (correct/total), streak counter; reset button.
- **Input UX**: Add card modal with validation (no empty fields); live preview flip.
- **Edge cases**: Handle empty decks gracefully; confirm deletes; max 50 cards/deck warning.
- Testable: Load, add 3 cards, study (2 correct/1 wrong), share URL, reload verifies state.
