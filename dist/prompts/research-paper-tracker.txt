Research Paper Tracker

• Single-file Python 3 script using only the standard library (json, csv, sqlite3, datetime, pathlib, argparse)
• Store research papers with metadata: title, authors, publication date, URL, tags, notes, and read/unread status
• Command-line interface with subcommands: add, list, search, tag, mark-read, export, import
• Persistent storage using JSON file (papers.json) in the script's directory; auto-create on first run
• Search functionality across title, authors, and tags with case-insensitive matching
• Tag management: add/remove tags from existing papers, list all unique tags
• Export papers to CSV format for external analysis or sharing
• Import papers from JSON file (for backup/transfer between systems)
• Mark papers as read/unread and filter list by read status
• Display papers in formatted table output (title, authors, date, status, tags)
• Input validation for URLs and required fields
• Help command with usage examples for each subcommand
• Sortable output by date added, publication date, or title
• Batch operations: delete papers by tag or date range
• Statistics: count total papers, read count, papers per tag, most-used authors
