Flashcard Forge
- Single-file Python 3 script using ONLY standard library (json, os, pickle, random, readline, sys)
- Create/manage flashcard decks for spaced repetition learning
- Data persistence: store decks as JSON in ~/.flashcard_forge/decks/ directory (auto-create if missing)
- Core commands (via interactive readline loop):
  * 'new deck <name>' - create empty deck
  * 'add <deck> "front" "back"' - add card (quotes allow spaces)
  * 'study <deck>' - enter study mode with spaced repetition
  * 'list' - show all decks with card counts
  * 'stats <deck>' - show review history (cards due, success rate)
  * 'quit' - exit
- Study mode features:
  * Show front, wait for Enter to reveal back
  * Rate difficulty: '1'=easy (delay 7 days), '2'=medium (3 days), '3'=hard (1 day), '4'=again (immediate)
  * Auto-save review timestamps and ratings to card metadata
  * Prioritize overdue cards first (sort by due_date)
  * Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+C to quit study, 'q' to deck menu
- Undo/redo: last 10 actions (add/delete card) stored in memory, 'undo'/'redo' commands
- Offline-first: all data local, no network required
- Testable features:
  * Run script, create "math" deck, add 3 cards, study session rating 1-4, verify stats show due dates
  * Delete deck with 'del <deck>', list shows empty, undo restores it
  * Persistence survives script restart
- Use pathlib for paths, tab-completion via readline, colored output with ANSI escapes
- ~500 LOC max, shebang #!/usr/bin/env python3, if __name__ == "__main__" guard
