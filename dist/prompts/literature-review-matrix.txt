Literature Review Matrix

- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS, no external libraries or resources
- Purpose: Create, organize, and manage a literature review matrix for academic research
- Core UI: Fullscreen table with 7 fixed columns (Author(s), Year, Study Design, Sample Size, Key Findings, Methodology Strengths, Gaps/Critiques, Notes)
- Drag-and-drop reordering of rows and columns (use HTML5 drag API)
- Add/delete rows with "+" and "×" buttons in each row; add new column button in header
- Inline editing: Click any cell to edit text content (contenteditable with Enter to save, Esc to cancel)
- Persistence: Save/load entire matrix to localStorage automatically on change; load on startup; "Export" button saves as print-friendly HTML
- Print-friendly view: Ctrl+P triggers simplified black-text table (hides UI chrome, removes shadows, fits page width)
- Dark/light auto theme: Detects prefers-color-scheme on load, toggle button (☀️/🌙), persists preference in localStorage
- Keyboard support: Tab/Shift+Tab navigates cells, Arrow keys move focus, Enter edits cell, Ctrl+Enter adds row below
- Responsive: Mobile stacks columns vertically below 768px, touch drag support
- Search/filter: Top input filters rows by any column content (case-insensitive)
- Sort columns: Click header toggles ascending/descending (stable sort)
- Undo stack: Ctrl+Z undoes last add/edit/delete/sort (10-step history)
- Initial state: Pre-populate 3 sample rows of research papers for demo
- Accessibility: ARIA labels on table, screen-reader friendly row/column announcements, high-contrast mode support
- CSS: CSS Grid for table layout, smooth animations for row add/delete/reorder, glassmorphism cards for controls
- Max performance: Virtual row rendering if >50 rows (only render visible rows)
- File size target: Complete app under 15KB minified (test with base64 encode)
